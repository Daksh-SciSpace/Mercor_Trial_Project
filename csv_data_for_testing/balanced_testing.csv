And that was for the event that was happening in Delhi. And, uh, we made an object detection model using, uh, Yolo v 3. It's a darknet based backbone, and we use it. We optimized it. We fine tuned it on the dataset for our treasure hunt. So, basically, we have a we have data for QR codes, and we have to label them. And then we have to train the model on uh, YOLO v 5 uh, v 3 model, sorry, on those dataset. And we got an accuracy of above 90%, and we evaluated that, uh, and the evaluation accuracy was also near 91%. And we used the model in run time, and we deploy optimized it. And then we quantized it on a 4 bit, And we put that on Zetson Nano, and we, uh, showed that in an event where people were using or doing the Treasure Hut.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Implementing asynchronous encryption processes is indeed a smart approach. How did you specifically leverage asynchronous functionality in the encryption and verification processes, perhaps within your Node.js and Express.js backend, to maintain that balance?  

Interviewee: So, uh, asynchronous programming was basically implemented by, uh, like, the function which was made which were, uh, for an example, like, when a button click is made and the API request is sent, uh, for the first time when the user is trying to sign up, what is happening is that, uh, a particular, uh, function is basically written and which is basically, uh, that function is called on that button click.

How did you specifically leverage asynchronous functionality in the encryption and verification processes, perhaps within your Node.js and Express.js backend, to maintain that balance?  

Interviewee: So, uh, asynchronous programming was basically implemented by, uh, like, the function which was made which were, uh, for an example, like, when a button click is made and the API request is sent, uh, for the first time when the user is trying to sign up, what is happening is that, uh, a particular, uh, function is basically written and which is basically, uh, that function is called on that button click.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have extensive experience in the full software lifecycle, particularly in the financial services sector. Could you walk me through a complex project you led from inception to completion, focusing on the challenges you faced and how you overcame them?  

Interviewee: Yeah. So, um, I work currently, um, for a company called Envestnet, and they have, um, a platform called, uh, Unified Asset Management Platform, which is for all the asset managers, uh, who are working on for all the asset managers, uh, who are working on trading within the platform. It was a complicated project because we had to cater to many customers and their preferences. Uh, because all asset management management firms, they work on a variety of modules. So we had to talk to a lot of clients, uh, a lot of financial advisers get their opinion on what they require from a reporting perspective. And daily had to, uh, you know, uh, from the time I log in till I log out, I had around 4 to 5 meetings over 1 hour for the initial to, uh, 1 to 2 months to understand the requirements of each of these firms and the financial adviser of the advisers of these firms. So I have to consolidate all of their requirements and uh, make that into a business requirement document, um, and, uh, ensure that this is achieved. All of their, uh, goals are achieved in the platform in the reporting module. And this was a great challenge because, um, our development team also, uh, this was one of the first times, uh, in which they were working on such such kind of an effort. But, thankfully, over the course of around 6 months, I was able to aggregate all of the requirements, consolidate, find the common ground, and, uh, form a, uh, critical and extensive business requirement document as well as a functional requirement document. I also, uh, use the stories on top of that and coordinate with, uh, our stakeholders, uh, investment management firms as well as our development team and ensure that we, uh, build a stable and robust reporting module which caters to all the audience. And finally, after the client demo, we got to know, uh, from the feedback of all the clients that they were all pretty happy with, uh, what we achieved and gave us a rating of 9 plus out of 10. So that was one of the most, uh, defining points of my career and something which I was really proud about because this is not an easy effort, uh, to pull off.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That was a comprehensive overview, thank you. It's clear you tackled some significant challenges with data preprocessing and NLP application. Moving on, could you describe the specific approach you took to combine CNN and SVM for the image classification POC? What led you to choose this hybrid approach, and how did it perform in terms of accuracy?  

Interviewee: So answering to your question, John, uh, there were many models that I could have used, but it was not just a random that I put CNN and SVM. Right? Uh, CNN is used for visual classification, for visual data objects. So, uh, the use case was such that I had to use CNN, first of all. Coming back to the choice of SVM, so I had many techniques such as I could have used k means. I could have used regression. I could have used clustering. I could have used classification. I could have used anything to classify the object, but why only SPM? It was because I tried every possible technique. I I I tested for around 21 models to be precise. And then I came to a conclusion that I had to use SVM. Because what SVM, uh, SVM is support vector machines. Right? And it is basically used for classification. And the problem on the use case was such like I had to classify first the objects into plastic or metal, and then it was I had to classify into brittle or tactile. So, uh, SVM using the kernel method, I use the kernel method for classifying, uh, was giving me uh, I practice around uh, I took around 21 models, as I said, and the highest accuracy that I got was around with k means clustering and with SPM, but the k means clustering was giving me an accuracy of around 70% or such. Uh, but SVM gave me an exact accuracy of 84%, which is a very high standards of, uh, accuracy. I had to give many ebooks, and I had to, uh, apply many data augmentation techniques. And I had to, uh, even apply elder regularization and overfitting to the model to improve the accuracy of the model. But this is how I, uh, use an hybrid model and hybrid classification techniques to actually classify the images which are given to me. So first, uh, as I said, uh, to coming, uh, coming giving a summary to what you answered, why I choose SVM because SVM, uh, was a was SVM support vector machine, and it is used to derive, uh, to give and it gave me a high accuracy when compared to other 21 models which I used. And SVM was, uh, sounds a better classification techniques when it when the support vectors are actually nearer to the hyperplane which you're choosing.

It's clear you tackled some significant challenges with data preprocessing and NLP application. Moving on, could you describe the specific approach you took to combine CNN and SVM for the image classification POC? What led you to choose this hybrid approach, and how did it perform in terms of accuracy?  

Interviewee: So answering to your question, John, uh, there were many models that I could have used, but it was not just a random that I put CNN and SVM. Right? Uh, CNN is used for visual classification, for visual data objects. So, uh, the use case was such that I had to use CNN, first of all. Coming back to the choice of SVM, so I had many techniques such as I could have used k means. I could have used regression. I could have used clustering. I could have used classification. I could have used anything to classify the object, but why only SPM? It was because I tried every possible technique. I I I tested for around 21 models to be precise. And then I came to a conclusion that I had to use SVM. Because what SVM, uh, SVM is support vector machines. Right? And it is basically used for classification. And the problem on the use case was such like I had to classify first the objects into plastic or metal, and then it was I had to classify into brittle or tactile. So, uh, SVM using the kernel method, I use the kernel method for classifying, uh, was giving me uh, I practice around uh, I took around 21 models, as I said, and the highest accuracy that I got was around with k means clustering and with SPM, but the k means clustering was giving me an accuracy of around 70% or such. Uh, but SVM gave me an exact accuracy of 84%, which is a very high standards of, uh, accuracy. I had to give many ebooks, and I had to, uh, apply many data augmentation techniques. And I had to, uh, even apply elder regularization and overfitting to the model to improve the accuracy of the model. But this is how I, uh, use an hybrid model and hybrid classification techniques to actually classify the images which are given to me. So first, uh, as I said, uh, to coming, uh, coming giving a summary to what you answered, why I choose SVM because SVM, uh, was a was SVM support vector machine, and it is used to derive, uh, to give and it gave me a high accuracy when compared to other 21 models which I used. And SVM was, uh, sounds a better classification techniques when it when the support vectors are actually nearer to the hyperplane which you're choosing. Unfortunately, in this case, uh, the it's standard good. That is why I use SVM. And, uh, CNN was a very obvious choice, to be honest, John, because, uh, the use case was such that it involves the, uh, which involves visual objects. So that is why I had to use CNN.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your explanation of the rubrics for both project-based and written assessments is quite detailed. Shifting focus a bit, I'd like to explore the technical skills listed on your resume. Starting with C, can you discuss a particularly challenging project or problem you've solved using C, and the specific features or aspects of the language that were instrumental in your solution?  


Interviewee: Well, for the c during my graduation, uh, years, I, uh, like, worked upon creating a project where there was a quiz and the marks were displayed of the students. Um, using the c language, we created a project that was a group project. And, yes, there there there's a challenge while using c because, you know, when uh, one there's one error and you try to remove that error and, generally, you end up with 100 errors. So we need to be very careful while using it.

So we need to be very careful while using it.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2115, 7526, 1997, 1996, 14548, 7277, 2015, 2005, 2119, 2622, 1011, 2241, 1998, 2517, 20794, 2003, 3243, 6851, 1012, 9564, 3579, 1037, 2978, 1010, 1045, 1005, 1040, 2066, 2000, 8849, 1996, 4087, 4813, 3205, 2006, 2115, 13746, 1012, 3225, 2007, 1039, 1010, 2064, 2017, 6848, 1037, 3391, 10368, 2622, 2030, 3291, 2017, 1005, 2310, 13332, 2478, 1039, 1010, 1998, 1996, 3563, 2838, 2030, 5919, 1997, 1996, 2653, 2008, 2020, 6150, 1999, 2115, 5576, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 2092, 1010, 2005, 1996, 1039, 2076, 2026, 7665, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2086, 1010, 1045, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2499, 2588, 4526, 1037, 2622, 2073, 2045, 2001, 1037, 19461, 1998, 1996, 6017, 2020, 6913, 1997, 1996, 2493, 1012, 8529, 1010, 2478, 1996, 1039, 2653, 1010, 2057, 2580, 1037, 2622, 2008, 2001, 1037, 2177, 2622, 1012, 1998, 1010, 2748, 1010, 2045, 2045, 2045, 1005, 1055, 1037, 4119, 2096, 2478, 1039, 2138, 1010, 2017, 2113, 1010, 2043, 7910, 1010, 2028, 2045, 1005, 1055, 2028, 7561, 1998, 2017, 3046, 2000, 6366, 2008, 7561, 1998, 1010, 3227, 1010, 2017, 2203, 2039, 2007, 2531, 10697, 1012, 2061, 2057, 2342, 2000, 2022, 2200, 6176, 2096, 2478, 2009, 1012, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your approach to supervising the zone 3 protection using an algorithm that combines the traditional distance relay operation with a new criterion based on power and angle is quite innovative. When you mention using an AND operation between the distance relay and your proposed algorithm, could you elaborate on how this logic was implemented in MATLAB? Additionally, how did you validate the effectiveness of this supervisory scheme in your simulations, particularly in terms of its ability to accurately distinguish between fault and non-fault conditions? 


Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so I'll say, uh, I, uh, I, uh, took the the the voltage and current phasers, and I took that phasers in the dot mat file or workspace. Both, uh, I have worked on both of them. So I took that, uh, voltage and current phasers from a bus. Okay? And then I, uh, used the formula for active power at the bus using the, uh, voltage and current phasers, and I, uh, used the voltage angle concept, the voltage angles between, uh, different, uh, areas of a network. So, uh, like, if you have a 2 area system, I took the area of one area, uh, angle of in one area and angle of another area and power flow between that area. So, uh, the product of that area should be, uh, positive. If it is, uh, if it is positive, then it is a non fault condition. And, uh, along with that, the distance relay is also taking a distance relay operation is also taking place. So you have to provide an and operation. If it is negative and, uh, the distance relay is, uh, showing the zone 3 operation, then it is a fault condition. But if it is positive, the active power and, uh, volt and voltage angle difference con product is positive and it is showing the, uh, that zone 3 is encroaching, then, uh, zone 3 is not operating correctly. It means that, uh, there is a no fault condition. It can be a power swing condition or different voltage stress condition, load encroachment condition, different cases are there. Uh, so based on this, I propose my idea.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you conducted courses on programming languages and data science at Easy2Learning. Can you elaborate on the specific topics you covered in your data science courses, and how you structured them to cater to both online and offline students?  


Interviewee: Okay, sir. So at easy to learning, I covered a comprehensive range of topics aimed at providing students with solid foundation and advanced knowledge in programming and data science. The topics are included, uh, firstly at C programming. I included C programming as basics of C programming, data types, variables, control structure, loops, constant recursors, pointers, structures and renewals violently. Then secondly, I take course on Java. Uh, they are they are basics index and data types, autoreflow statements, object oriented programmings, class objects, method, and details, polymer cuisine, encapsulations, in exceptional handling Java collection framework input or push stream multithreading. And I also take courses on Python there thereafter, uh, data types, variables, control, control, content and modules, file handling, exception handling, NumPy, pandas, oops, plus, Django. And I also take courses on data structure and algorithms like arrays, linguistics, excuse, trees, graphs, has sinks. And has sinks. And, uh, there are certain algorithms which I also covered, like sorting algorithm, like bubble sort, not sort, quick sort, and searching algorithm, like linear search, binary search, and graph algorithms. And there there after, I take a recent course on the data science that is data analysis and geologists and machine learning and add some additional topics like HTML systems, our skip, and this group. That's all.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've worked extensively with Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation using XLNet. Can you walk me through the process you followed to implement these techniques and how you ensured their accuracy and efficiency?  

Interviewee: Uh, for, uh, named under recognition and named entity disambiguation problem, I had actually applied. Um, I mean, we have actual dataset where we have, uh, the, um, where we have this entity tagged. And, um, so, um, and also I use I, uh, also use the knowledge graph from Wikipedia to get, uh, this entity, uh, linked. And I had trained the model, and I I basically use this foundation model as Excel net. And, um, uh, so, uh, so basically using Excel net, I use this name. I, uh, so I basically did this name entity, uh, name and recognition. And whatever entity entities I found with this and, uh, I'm from this NER. I further, uh, train using this knowledge graph embedding to get this, finally, this Wikipedia link. So that's how I did it. And in order to ensure that my accuracy is at par, so I I had to actually use basically the AB testing framework, which we what we have deployed. So for AB testing framework, so we had a basic, um, named entity recognition system in place. Uh, so, uh, so what was happening that, uh, since there are many more, um, uh, like, named entities, uh, I mean, the entities which are having the similar names. Let's say, um, uh, some person named Edison and also the Edison we know as a famous, uh, he was a famous scientist. Right? So how to understand that, uh, both of these editions are are different? So I can example, um, I mean, uh, so yeah. So in fact, there are several places, um, like, um, uh, which is, uh, an extra different part of the world. So how to know that whether these two places are different? So we have a a so, basically, we had, uh, a kind of a named entity recognition system which was deployed. And it had, uh, our I mean, it had this, uh, precision recall and earphones course already in place. So yeah. So, basically, in order to, uh, measure the efficiencies of the system, efficacy system, we computed these 2 metrics, position recall and if one score and also ROCUC. Uh, so, uh, mostly, the most important metric is the precision. And also recall also, I mean, it should be it should be basically high precision. Uh, but, uh, even though so that's actually a kind of a trade off between the precision and recall. So mostly, we can check the f and score also because which is a harmonic mean. Uh, now, uh, we deployed this uh, system with this name and digit disambiguation as well. And we tracked, uh, the system performances in terms of these three metrics. And, um, and and, basically, we and, uh, and yeah. Uh, so also, so yeah. So, basically, this is how we, uh, did, uh, find out, uh, the efficacies and accuracy of the system. Apart from them, so so these are these are the offline metrics of the system. And online metrics in this case, uh, should be the actual, uh, I mean, actual, um, tags which are there in this, uh, in these articles. So these articles I mean, these, uh, NDT recognition and NDT disambiguations were used in, uh, many news articles. So, uh, which was, uh, so which were used in kind of an app, which was, uh, which was then was being developed. So so we have,

So, basically, in order to, uh, measure the efficiencies of the system, efficacy system, we computed these 2 metrics, position recall and if one score and also ROCUC. Uh, so, uh, mostly, the most important metric is the precision. And also recall also, I mean, it should be it should be basically high precision. Uh, but, uh, even though so that's actually a kind of a trade off between the precision and recall. So mostly, we can check the f and score also because which is a harmonic mean. Uh, now, uh, we deployed this uh, system with this name and digit disambiguation as well. And we tracked, uh, the system performances in terms of these three metrics. And, um, and and, basically, we and, uh, and yeah. Uh, so also, so yeah. So, basically, this is how we, uh, did, uh, find out, uh, the efficacies and accuracy of the system. Apart from them, so so these are these are the offline metrics of the system. And online metrics in this case, uh, should be the actual, uh, I mean, actual, um, tags which are there in this, uh, in these articles. So these articles I mean, these, uh, NDT recognition and NDT disambiguations were used in, uh, many news articles. So, uh, which was, uh, so which were used in kind of an app, which was, uh, which was then was being developed. So so we have,","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2307, 999, 1045, 2156, 2013, 2115, 13746, 2008, 2017, 1005, 2310, 2499, 8077, 2007, 2315, 9178, 5038, 1998, 4487, 21559, 5638, 19696, 3508, 2478, 28712, 7159, 1012, 2064, 2017, 3328, 2033, 2083, 1996, 2832, 2017, 2628, 2000, 10408, 2122, 5461, 1998, 2129, 2017, 16316, 2037, 10640, 1998, 8122, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 7910, 1010, 2005, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2315, 2104, 5038, 1998, 2315, 9178, 4487, 21559, 5638, 19696, 3508, 3291, 1010, 1045, 2018, 2941, 4162, 1012, 8529, 1010, 1045, 2812, 1010, 2057, 2031, 5025, 2951, 13462, 2073, 2057, 2031, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1996, 1010, 8529, 1010, 2073, 2057, 2031, 2023, 9178, 26610, 1012, 1998, 1010, 8529, 1010, 2061, 1010, 8529, 1010, 1998, 2036, 1045, 2224, 1045, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2036, 2224, 1996, 3716, 10629, 2013, 16948, 2000, 2131, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2023, 9178, 1010, 7910, 1010, 5799, 1012, 1998, 1045, 2018, 4738, 1996, 2944, 1010, 1998, 1045, 1045, 10468, 2224, 2023, 3192, 2944, 2004, 24970, 5658, 1012, 1998, 1010, 8529, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 10468, 2478, 24970, 5658, 1010, 1045, 2224, 2023, 2171, 1012, 1045, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 1045, 10468, 2106, 2023, 2171, 9178, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2171, 1998, 5038, 1012, 1998, 3649, 9178, 11422, 1045, 2179, 2007, 2023, 1998, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1045, 1005, 1049, 2013, 2023, 11265, 2099, 1012, 1045, 2582, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3345, 2478, 2023, 3716, 10629, 7861, 8270, 4667, 2000, 2131, 2023, 1010, 2633, 1010, 2023, 16948, 4957, 1012, 2061, 2008, 1005, 1055, 2129, 1045, 2106, 2009, 1012, 1998, 1999, 2344, 2000, 5676, 2008, 2026, 10640, 2003, 2012, 11968, 1010, 2061, 1045, 1045, 2018, 2000, 2941, 2224, 10468, 1996, 11113, 5604, 7705, 1010, 2029, 2057, 2054, 2057, 2031, 7333, 1012, 2061, 2005, 11113, 5604, 7705, 1010, 2061, 2057, 2018, 1037, 3937, 1010, 8529, 1010, 2315, 9178, 5038, 2291, 1999, 2173, 1012, 7910, 1010, 2061, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 2054, 2001, 6230, 2008, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2144, 2045, 2024, 2116, 2062, 1010, 8529, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2315, 11422, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1045, 2812, 1010, 1996, 11422, 2029, 2024, 2383, 1996, 2714, 3415, 1012, 2292, 1005, 1055, 2360, 1010, 8529, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2070, 2711, 2315, 17046, 1998, 2036, 1996, 17046, 2057, 2113, 2004, 1037, 3297, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2002, 2001, 1037, 3297, 7155, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2061, 2129, 2000, 3305, 2008, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2119, 1997, 2122, 6572, 2024, 2024, 2367, 1029, 2061, 1045, 2064, 2742, 1010, 8529, 1010, 1045, 2812, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 3398, 1012, 2061, 1999, 2755, 1010, 2045, 2024, 2195, 3182, 1010, 8529, 1010, 2066, 1010, 8529, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2029, 2003, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2019, 4469, 2367, 2112, 1997, 1996, 2088, 1012, 2061, 2129, 2000, 2113, 2008, 3251, 2122, 2048, 3182, 2024, 2367, 1029, 2061, 2057, 2031, 1037, 1037, 2061, 1010, 10468, 1010, 2057, 2018, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1037, 2785, 1997, 1037, 2315, 9178, 5038, 2291, 2029, 2001, 7333, 1012, 1998, 2009, 2018, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2256, 1045, 2812, 1010, 2009, 2018, 2023, 1010, 7910, 1010, 11718, 9131, 1998, 4540, 19093, 2607, 2525, 1999, 2173, 1012, 2061, 3398, 1012, 2061, 1010, 102]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a solid rationale for choosing Golang. Given your experience with both Golang and NodeJS in a microservices context, how did you handle service-to-service communication, and what factors influenced your choice of approach (e.g., REST, gRPC, or other protocols)?  


Interviewee: Okay. So between the like, the communication between the microservices, I have worked on 3 technologies, like I have created APIs, rest APIs. And for the communication, I have worked on RabbitMQ. And I have also involved on Kafka. So the basic difference is, like, when we want, like, for the REST API, like, when we want a certainty, like, If, like, they're it's a very you can say, a sensitive data or something. Like, you have to pass a sensitive data to a payment service or a encrypted message. Then we can like, in that case, I have developed this REST APIs for the communication. I have used RabbitMQ for the communication of the like, sending the push notifications to the user, SMS, and email whenever your order is success and sending their invoices and everything. This has been done with RevitMQ. And recently, I have worked on Kafka for the inter service communication, like, currently in my current organization, that is, I am using Kafka called inter service communication because, like, because we had to do a this even driven architecture for our payment system because some of the payment gateways were getting timed out in high when there was a lot large load on our service. So some of the gateways were getting time out. So we needed a system, a mediator system, where we can actually throttle the number of requests per second to the gateway so that the gateway doesn't time out, and we can like, in the peak hours, we can relay the request, and we can actually moderate those. So in that case, I'm using Kafka.

So in that case, I'm using Kafka.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2008, 1005, 1055, 1037, 5024, 11581, 2063, 2005, 10549, 2175, 25023, 1012, 2445, 2115, 3325, 2007, 2119, 2175, 25023, 1998, 13045, 22578, 1999, 1037, 12702, 8043, 7903, 2229, 6123, 1010, 2129, 2106, 2017, 5047, 2326, 1011, 2000, 1011, 2326, 4807, 1010, 1998, 2054, 5876, 5105, 2115, 3601, 1997, 3921, 1006, 1041, 1012, 1043, 1012, 1010, 2717, 1010, 24665, 15042, 1010, 2030, 2060, 16744, 1007, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 3100, 1012, 2061, 2090, 1996, 2066, 1010, 1996, 4807, 2090, 1996, 12702, 8043, 7903, 2229, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2499, 2006, 1017, 6786, 1010, 2066, 1045, 2031, 2580, 17928, 2015, 1010, 2717, 17928, 2015, 1012, 1998, 2005, 1996, 4807, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2499, 2006, 10442, 2213, 4160, 1012, 1998, 1045, 2031, 2036, 2920, 2006, 10556, 24316, 2050, 1012, 2061, 1996, 3937, 4489, 2003, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2043, 2057, 2215, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2005, 1996, 2717, 17928, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2043, 2057, 2215, 1037, 15855, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2065, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2027, 1005, 2128, 2009, 1005, 1055, 1037, 2200, 2017, 2064, 2360, 1010, 1037, 7591, 2951, 2030, 2242, 1012, 2066, 1010, 2017, 2031, 2000, 3413, 1037, 7591, 2951, 2000, 1037, 7909, 2326, 2030, 1037, 4372, 26775, 22571, 3064, 4471, 1012, 2059, 2057, 2064, 2066, 1010, 1999, 2008, 2553, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2764, 2023, 2717, 17928, 2015, 2005, 1996, 4807, 1012, 1045, 2031, 2109, 10442, 2213, 4160, 2005, 1996, 4807, 1997, 1996, 2066, 1010, 6016, 1996, 5245, 26828, 2015, 2000, 1996, 5310, 1010, 22434, 1010, 1998, 10373, 7188, 2115, 2344, 2003, 3112, 1998, 6016, 2037, 1999, 6767, 23522, 1998, 2673, 1012, 2023, 2038, 2042, 2589, 2007, 7065, 4183, 2213, 4160, 1012, 1998, 3728, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2499, 2006, 10556, 24316, 2050, 2005, 1996, 6970, 2326, 4807, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2747, 1999, 2026, 2783, 3029, 1010, 2008, 2003, 1010, 1045, 2572, 2478, 10556, 24316, 2050, 2170, 6970, 2326, 4807, 2138, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2138, 2057, 2018, 2000, 2079, 1037, 2023, 2130, 5533, 4294, 2005, 2256, 7909, 2291, 2138, 2070, 1997, 1996, 7909, 11909, 2015, 2020, 2893, 22313, 2041, 1999, 2152, 2043, 2045, 2001, 1037, 2843, 2312, 7170, 2006, 2256, 2326, 1012, 2061, 2070, 1997, 1996, 11909, 2015, 2020, 2893, 2051, 2041, 1012, 2061, 2057, 2734, 1037, 2291, 1010, 1037, 2865, 4263, 2291, 1010, 2073, 2057, 2064, 2941, 24420, 1996, 2193, 1997, 11186, 2566, 2117, 2000, 1996, 11909, 2061, 2008, 1996, 11909, 2987, 1005, 1056, 2051, 2041, 1010, 1998, 2057, 2064, 2066, 1010, 1999, 1996, 4672, 2847, 1010, 2057, 2064, 8846, 1996, 5227, 1010, 1998, 2057, 2064, 2941, 8777, 2216, 1012, 2061, 1999, 2008, 2553, 1010, 1045, 1005, 1049, 2478, 10556, 24316, 2050, 1012, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach to improving the search functionality. It's clear you have a strong grasp on using external tools like Algolia to enhance the user experience. Given your experience with search services, how did you ensure the scalability and reliability of the search service, especially considering the high volume of data and traffic that Swiggy handles?  

Interviewee: So yeah. I mean, at Swiggy Skills, it is important for us to see whether as whatever the code which we have written or the intermediary service which we had written between our own service and Algolia. They are kind of horizontally scalable. As I said, most of the, uh, technical or the algorithmic uh, challenge was taken care by Algolia itself. Our services all was horizontally scalable and lightweight on top of, uh, Algolia. So we basically created an interface, which was just directly talking to Algolia and passing the user's parameter and the search context and getting the results. So from that, we have services or lightweight. We were just providing an interface so that in later in future, if you want to fine tune it or probably migrate to a different product, we can do that. As I said, like, our services being lightweight, it these were, like, horizontally scalable. We were we were, uh, basically utilizing a particular instance on machine, CPU, and memory to see how much request for second half service can take and basis that we had automated workflows, uh, which were basically either scaling up or scaling down basis, the p cards. So that that was more from, um, uh, client to request point of view from a data pipeline point of view where we are uploading huge among this amount of data to their Algolia products. So, initially, we started like, when I wrote a simple MVP, we were just basically directly uploading date like, pulling data from a snowflake table and uploading it to s 3 and then doing a batch processing to Algolia. But there there we saw key. Given the huge amount of data we have, it takes a lot of time for us to send that data to Algolia, Algolia being a third party products. So there, I figured out there is a product but that there is a technical s three select where I can upload a file to s 3 and then use that s 3 select to do a intelligent batch processing. What it will do is it will need a bunch of data in concurrently or entirely, and then it will pull that data from s 3 and call the Algolia dashboard. I mean, Algolia ML API concurrently. So there, we were able to almost improve that performance time by 20 x. Whatever we were able to earlier upload by, like, in, like, hours, we were able to do that, like, in couple of minutes. So that was one thing which we have done. Impressive

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: I see you've been working with both Digital TaaS LLC and Quantrion LLC. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging legacy web application you've worked on at Digital TaaS and how you approached troubleshooting and solution design for it?  

Interviewee: So one of the legacy applications that I came across, digital task, was lead 5, which is actually somewhat, uh, close to LinkedIn. But, uh, in LinkedIn, everyone could join, but, uh, in lead 5, it is only for the c level post. And, uh, so they already had a application that was, uh, written in Java, uh, Java, I think, 10 years back. And they gave us the project to revamp it using the latest technologies of, um, like, Node Angular and, uh, basically, it was it has to be written in means tag again. So, also, they had the database earlier as Postgres. So they had some problems scaling that database as well. And so we dealt with all those things, uh, with the new one. But the challenge was they want their original legacy app to still function, uh, because the admin panels and all those things were present over there. The most challenging part in that project, I would say, is syncing the database between the post press database versus the MongoDB. So there, we used the the post press concept called a wall, the right ahead logging, And using the Debezium connectors, that wall need should always, like it it used to detect those changes, the CDC, and push them into a Kafka queue. The debasing used to push them into the Kafka queue. And in our side of APIs, which were written in NestJS, so we had, uh, we always listen to that Kafka queue every time. And whenever there is some message that comes in, so we transform that. We had some transformer logics within, uh, the NestJS controllers. And using those controllers, the data which came from the old postgres database was transformed and made properly into the MongoDB schema. And here, it was primarily MongoDB. And, mostly, the new application that was present was read only. So the data, the main admin things, and all of those things were handled still in they are still date handled in the legacy application. But our goal was to make the user facing app, um, rewind the user facing app. So for that, they used to need some performance because they were scaling, uh, bit well. So they needed to have that performance. So those performances they got with the newer technologies because these are horizontally scalable. Our APIs are horizontally scalable. Uh, they are individual. The Angular application, of course, it doesn't need that much of scalability because it is a static application deployed on the s three bucket in AWS, but it is also served using CloudFront there. So, overall, MongoDB has a good, you know, clusters, uh, with which it can scale horizontally as well. So like this, we enhance the performance of that application.

So like this, we enhance the performance of that application.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 1045, 2156, 2017, 1005, 2310, 2042, 2551, 2007, 2119, 3617, 11937, 3022, 11775, 1998, 24110, 18886, 2239, 11775, 1012, 2064, 2017, 2425, 2033, 2055, 1037, 3391, 10368, 8027, 4773, 4646, 2017, 1005, 2310, 2499, 2006, 2012, 3617, 11937, 3022, 1998, 2129, 2017, 5411, 13460, 23416, 2075, 1998, 5576, 2640, 2005, 2009, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 2061, 2028, 1997, 1996, 8027, 5097, 2008, 1045, 2234, 2408, 1010, 3617, 4708, 1010, 2001, 2599, 1019, 1010, 2029, 2003, 2941, 5399, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2485, 2000, 5799, 2378, 1012, 2021, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1999, 5799, 2378, 1010, 3071, 2071, 3693, 1010, 2021, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1999, 2599, 1019, 1010, 2009, 2003, 2069, 2005, 1996, 1039, 2504, 2695, 1012, 1998, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 2027, 2525, 2018, 1037, 4646, 2008, 2001, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2517, 1999, 9262, 1010, 7910, 1010, 9262, 1010, 1045, 2228, 1010, 2184, 2086, 2067, 1012, 1998, 2027, 2435, 2149, 1996, 2622, 2000, 7065, 16613, 2009, 2478, 1996, 6745, 6786, 1997, 1010, 8529, 1010, 2066, 1010, 13045, 16108, 1998, 1010, 7910, 1010, 10468, 1010, 2009, 2001, 2009, 2038, 2000, 2022, 2517, 1999, 2965, 6415, 2153, 1012, 2061, 1010, 2036, 1010, 2027, 2018, 1996, 7809, 3041, 2004, 2695, 17603, 2015, 1012, 2061, 2027, 2018, 2070, 3471, 25169, 2008, 7809, 2004, 2092, 1012, 1998, 2061, 2057, 9411, 2007, 2035, 2216, 2477, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2007, 1996, 2047, 2028, 1012, 2021, 1996, 4119, 2001, 2027, 2215, 2037, 2434, 8027, 10439, 2000, 2145, 3853, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2138, 1996, 4748, 10020, 9320, 1998, 2035, 2216, 2477, 2020, 2556, 2058, 2045, 1012, 1996, 2087, 10368, 2112, 1999, 2008, 2622, 1010, 1045, 2052, 2360, 1010, 2003, 26351, 2075, 1996, 7809, 2090, 1996, 2695, 2811, 7809, 6431, 1996, 12256, 3995, 18939, 1012, 2061, 2045, 1010, 2057, 2109, 1996, 1996, 2695, 2811, 4145, 2170, 1037, 2813, 1010, 1996, 2157, 3805, 15899, 1010, 1998, 2478, 1996, 2139, 4783, 5831, 2819, 19400, 2015, 1010, 2008, 2813, 2342, 2323, 2467, 1010, 2066, 2009, 2009, 2109, 2000, 11487, 2216, 3431, 1010, 1996, 26629, 1010, 1998, 5245, 2068, 2046, 1037, 10556, 24316, 2050, 24240, 1012, 1996, 2139, 22083, 2075, 2109, 2000, 5245, 2068, 2046, 1996, 10556, 24316, 2050, 24240, 1012, 1998, 1999, 2256, 2217, 1997, 17928, 2015, 1010, 2029, 2020, 2517, 1999, 9089, 22578, 1010, 2061, 2057, 2018, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2057, 2467, 4952, 2000, 2008, 10556, 24316, 2050, 24240, 2296, 2051, 1012, 1998, 7188, 2045, 2003, 2070, 4471, 2008, 3310, 1999, 1010, 2061, 2057, 10938, 2008, 1012, 2057, 2018, 2070, 10938, 2121, 7961, 2015, 2306, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1996, 9089, 22578, 21257, 1012, 1998, 2478, 2216, 21257, 1010, 1996, 2951, 2029, 2234, 2013, 1996, 2214, 2695, 17603, 2015, 7809, 2001, 8590, 1998, 2081, 7919, 2046, 1996, 12256, 3995, 18939, 8040, 28433, 1012, 1998, 2182, 1010, 2009, 2001, 3952, 12256, 3995, 18939, 1012, 1998, 1010, 3262, 1010, 1996, 2047, 4646, 2008, 2001, 2556, 2001, 3191, 2069, 1012, 2061, 1996, 2951, 1010, 1996, 2364, 4748, 10020, 2477, 1010, 1998, 2035, 1997, 2216, 2477, 2020, 8971, 2145, 1999, 2027, 2024, 2145, 3058, 8971, 1999, 1996, 8027, 4646, 1012, 2021, 2256, 3125, 2001, 2000, 2191, 102]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your approach to data validation using SQL for S4 Hana integration is quite insightful. Could you explain how you optimized the SQL scripts for performance, especially considering the volume of data being processed? What specific techniques or features of SQL did you leverage to ensure the validation process remained efficient?  

Interviewee: Uh, look. It was not that, uh, huge amount of data. So since the client was only one client and it had it had, uh, not that many amount of customers, so it was a local, uh, if I'm considering about there were 13, 15, uh, sites for that customer, like, different countries having different, uh, uh, organization, so those are the particular customers for that client. And each and every vendor, supposing I'm talking about, like, IBL is the client, and its customer vendor is, like, one of them is Indorama Ventures, uh, Brazil. It's one of the vendors it is. So what are the customers that particular vendor is dealing with? So you can say that the normal amount would be 2 to 3000, uh, per phase. We extracted in, uh, 3 to 4 phases, the data. We extracted the data for the SAP system. And that those particular four phases, we, uh, found that they were not more than 2,000 or that is the max amount of data. So what happens is that when you are getting that amount of data, uh, uh, which is not that huge but still a comprehensive amount, you get to find that there are 3, 4 key factors indicating the columns. And those each and every column in the data has to be have a particular significant rule according to which the particular value has to be pasted. So, like, if you are having a date column, it has to be given in the particular format of date, like date, day day, d d, then month, then year. So, like, that kind of a format. So if the particular format is not scripted in that way, in the SQL, we will be getting that particular fallout. And after getting that particular fallout, we can check what is the data type in the particular Excel or in the particular template which you have given. And, accordingly, we can change the data type, and we can, uh, improve it. We can customize it according to the date format, and then we can load it again. Now, supposedly, if you are having something which is okay or the client says, no, this particular value has to be given like this, and the SAP field is also, like, okay, you can't give any particular comprehensive value and, uh, we will be accepting it since there is no such rule. Uh, but, uh, according to the business validation which we are doing, like, particularly that customer does not have any relation with a particular other customer and the relationship has been created into the file but not in the, uh, system, then what will be it will be showing that that particular relationship is missing. So what we can do is we have a column named error flag. What we can do is we can change the error flag from y to n, and, subsequently, uh, I mean, so you can say what, uh, that we, uh, denied that particular have followed, and we corrected it. And we said that, though, this particular followed is not, uh, okay, and we can change it, and we can particularly load that data into different phases. So we have different, uh, you know, tables, like the pretarget datamake, which where the data, uh, then the I mean I mean, the load table, the depretarget, and the datamake table. Ultimately, the datamic table is where the, uh, particular prod system is being started from and the data is loaded into the, uh, s four HANA. So those particular validations are done there. So what we used, basically, comprehensive joins, like, left, right, uh, joins, then outer join, then we basically used, like, a different fields aliases in order to check what are the different field values which is given, whether the length is there or not. It has already been checked in the script. So if it is not, then we can check. But if it is coming as a follow, we can simply check it in the script, like, what is that current length and how much needs to be truncated from that particular value. We can update the value as well on the SQL. Uh, it's not much. If there is 1 or 2 values, then there is no need to go through the whole file changing process and loading it through different tables. We can simply use the update query in order to change the value in the system itself. And some those kind of, uh, particular, uh, results are given. And, accordingly, we used a truncated table then delete statement if it is ordered to be removed from the particular table and, uh, you know, insert particular queries, update particular queries, like all these kind of things in order to change the values and alter the values, uh, according to the correction and validation process in our fields of analysis.

And, accordingly, we used a truncated table then delete statement if it is ordered to be removed from the particular table and, uh, you know, insert particular queries, update particular queries, like all these kind of things in order to change the values and alter the values, uh, according to the correction and validation process in our fields of analysis.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2115, 3921, 2000, 2951, 27354, 2478, 29296, 2005, 1055, 2549, 26048, 8346, 2003, 3243, 12369, 3993, 1012, 2071, 2017, 4863, 2129, 2017, 23569, 27605, 5422, 1996, 29296, 14546, 2005, 2836, 1010, 2926, 6195, 1996, 3872, 1997, 2951, 2108, 13995, 1029, 2054, 3563, 5461, 2030, 2838, 1997, 29296, 2106, 2017, 21155, 2000, 5676, 1996, 27354, 2832, 2815, 8114, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 7910, 1010, 2298, 1012, 2009, 2001, 2025, 2008, 1010, 7910, 1010, 4121, 3815, 1997, 2951, 1012, 2061, 2144, 1996, 7396, 2001, 2069, 2028, 7396, 1998, 2009, 2018, 2009, 2018, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2025, 2008, 2116, 3815, 1997, 6304, 1010, 2061, 2009, 2001, 1037, 2334, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2065, 1045, 1005, 1049, 6195, 2055, 2045, 2020, 2410, 1010, 2321, 1010, 7910, 1010, 4573, 2005, 2008, 8013, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2367, 3032, 2383, 2367, 1010, 7910, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3029, 1010, 2061, 2216, 2024, 1996, 3327, 6304, 2005, 2008, 7396, 1012, 1998, 2169, 1998, 2296, 21431, 1010, 10514, 9397, 18606, 1045, 1005, 1049, 3331, 2055, 1010, 2066, 1010, 21307, 2140, 2003, 1996, 7396, 1010, 1998, 2049, 8013, 21431, 2003, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2028, 1997, 2068, 2003, 11424, 14672, 13252, 1010, 7910, 1010, 4380, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2028, 1997, 1996, 17088, 2009, 2003, 1012, 2061, 2054, 2024, 1996, 6304, 2008, 3327, 21431, 2003, 7149, 2007, 1029, 2061, 2017, 2064, 2360, 2008, 1996, 3671, 3815, 2052, 2022, 1016, 2000, 11910, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2566, 4403, 1012, 2057, 15901, 1999, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1017, 2000, 1018, 12335, 1010, 1996, 2951, 1012, 2057, 15901, 1996, 2951, 2005, 1996, 20066, 2291, 1012, 1998, 2008, 2216, 3327, 2176, 12335, 1010, 2057, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2179, 2008, 2027, 2020, 2025, 2062, 2084, 1016, 1010, 2199, 2030, 2008, 2003, 1996, 4098, 3815, 1997, 2951, 1012, 2061, 2054, 6433, 2003, 2008, 2043, 2017, 2024, 2893, 2008, 3815, 1997, 2951, 1010, 7910, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2029, 2003, 2025, 2008, 4121, 2021, 2145, 1037, 7721, 3815, 1010, 2017, 2131, 2000, 2424, 2008, 2045, 2024, 1017, 1010, 1018, 3145, 5876, 8131, 1996, 7753, 1012, 1998, 2216, 2169, 1998, 2296, 5930, 1999, 1996, 2951, 2038, 2000, 2022, 2031, 1037, 3327, 3278, 3627, 2429, 2000, 2029, 1996, 3327, 3643, 2038, 2000, 2022, 19351, 2094, 1012, 2061, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2383, 1037, 3058, 5930, 1010, 2009, 2038, 2000, 2022, 2445, 1999, 1996, 3327, 4289, 1997, 3058, 1010, 2066, 3058, 1010, 2154, 2154, 1010, 1040, 1040, 1010, 2059, 3204, 1010, 2059, 2095, 1012, 2061, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2008, 2785, 1997, 1037, 4289, 1012, 2061, 2065, 1996, 3327, 4289, 2003, 2025, 22892, 1999, 2008, 2126, 1010, 1999, 1996, 29296, 1010, 2057, 2097, 2022, 2893, 2008, 3327, 23902, 1012, 1998, 2044, 2893, 2008, 3327, 23902, 1010, 2057, 2064, 4638, 2054, 2003, 1996, 2951, 2828, 1999, 1996, 3327, 24970, 2030, 1999, 1996, 3327, 23561, 2029, 2017, 2031, 2445, 1012, 1998, 1010, 11914, 1010, 2057, 2064, 2689, 1996, 2951, 2828, 1010, 1998, 2057, 2064, 1010, 7910, 1010, 5335, 2009, 1012, 2057, 2064, 7661, 4697, 2009, 2429, 2000, 1996, 3058, 4289, 1010, 1998, 2059, 2057, 2064, 7170, 2009, 2153, 1012, 2085, 1010, 10743, 1010, 2065, 102]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Great! Can you describe a specific incident where you managed on-call duties that significantly improved service reliability for MySQL HeatWave on AWS? 


Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So there was this one time where we were experiencing a lot of, network packets disruptions. So, that was the very first time that I was on call, and, it was completely, new to me. And, the cloud operations team, which I am working on, is also relatively new, and we were starting out from scratch. So, actually, most of them had no idea where to exactly look at. But I had faced a similar issue during setting up one of my back end services, for a project that I have worked on back in college. So I remember that I had to go through bin locks and the MySQL error logs, for getting all the network packet related data. So there was this health monitor which runs within the MySQL instance, which sends all the metrics of the MySQL instance relating to the journal cuttle output, the system CTL output, the network packets, the health of the MySQL d process and everything. So after a thorough review of the TCP connection port, which is 3,900 and the MySQL port, which is 3306, I found out that there was a pattern of arrays of zeros and ones where zeros represent the successful connection and one represented the unsuccessful number of connections. So using this, I figured out that there was this problem that actually had a repeated pattern kind of a thing that was observed. So using that, I, figured out that, okay, there is a set of connection drop that actually happened when the MySQL d process was not able to connect to the HeatWave node. So that's, one such incident which actually, had a bug in the health monitor data plane agent. So data plane agent is nothing but it's the, agent where it tries to talk to the sidecar, which is the heatwave node. So my sequel, instance and the heatwave node is, parallel connection kind of a thing where, MySQL node has to talk to the heatwave node most of the time. So our data plane agent helps in that case. And a minor bug in data plane agent cost the network package to drop. And, I, figured out that there was this bug that actually happened, and it, helped us fix the push a hotfix for the bug, and improve the reliability by a lot because that's that issue was happening, in the past as well for a long time. But I, figured it out well during my first on call itself. So, yeah, that's

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: I'm doing well, thank you. Let's jump right in with your experience at Samsung Electronics. You mentioned working on Data Pipeline Services and various e-commerce services. Can you elaborate on the specific technologies you used to build these services, and any challenges you faced in terms of scalability or performance?  


Interviewee: Absolutely. So I worked on back end engineering for the most part. And I have worked on exchange pricing and payment services for Samsung Ecommerce. Along with that, I have also worked on, data pipeline services which is based off on, Golang. So, basically, for our live APIs, we use our tech stack is basically Node JS. That is post Chris and rapid f q. For, let's say, data pipelines, we use Golang. So it's entire it's an entirely consumer based service. So it is for most of our for the most part, it's for our internal, usages. Internal matrices and data processing, and it's based on Golang. For storing and get gathering data, we use ELK stack. When it comes to scalability, recently, we came up with a very interesting issue. So since I handle back end of pricing engine, we saw that, the number of live calls to our pricing services they were taking a lot of time. So the turnaround time was too high. Our coupons and pricing services are very huge. So we were using a single instance of Redis, till now. Now we have moved on to Redis clusters. Now we can effectively handle all the scan operations and already get set operations very well. Since now we have a whole management of master slave nodes. And, to talk in numbers, I think we can support up to 2.5 times. Of our usual capacity now.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Moving on to the technical skills listed on your resume, you mentioned expertise in data analytics. Can you describe a particularly challenging data analytics project you've worked on and the approach you took to solve the problem?  

Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So a particularly challenging data analytics project, which I worked on was uh, they're building the fraud engine for UBI. Now what happened earlier was, uh, some people are trying to defraud our system by SIM spoofing. That is, they were getting access to other people SIM by a social engineering approach. Now this is the number of people who are being defrauded. We looked at the complaints that we received and saw that what were the metrics or the variables in which the defrauded people preferred from the normal base. That is where was the distinction between normal behavior and fraudulent behavior. So first of all, we identified what are the variables that we want to target and should measure, which will indicate fraudulent behavior. So that was the first challenge. Now after we identified the variables, the second challenge was how do we set thresholds for these variables? That is if this, uh, the variable the value of this variable crosses this number, then it will be called fraudulent. And below it, it will be called non fraudulent. In order to do that, we run the numbers on the general population and the fraudulent population, and took an approach that minimizes false positives and maximizes true positives. That is highest position. So, uh, uh, on this basis so basically, the approach where the minimum number of innocent people are flagged and maximum number of fraudulent people are flagged. So on the values where there there was a clear separation between regular folks and the fraudulent folks, we set thresholds. Now after setting the thresholds, the next challenge is how to flag it in real time. That required us to build data models, as well as certain analysis, which needed to be done on Python. So we built certain data models, which would run automatically at a certain time in a day. Then I built a little Python script, which, uh, did some analysis. Uh, for example, name mismatch analysis. For fraudsters, there were high mismatch between the name that they have added on the super app versus the name that is there on the bank record. So to this mismatch required a fuzzy name, uh, matching, which was better than Python that then would have been possible on SQL or some other tool. So I ran a Python script, which took the data models that were running automatically and compared the names for the regular folks versus the Ferdinand folks on Python, it will schedule a job. Then those values would again feed into a table, which will, uh, again, we run periodically. And after that, uh, after both of those jobs were done, I set up a 3rd job, which would, uh, output which would, you know, put forward the output of this exercise on a Slack channel. That is these are the people who have been flatbed or driven. So there were multiple lists. They were identifying the variables. They were setting thresholds and setting the pipeline, which would actually indicate and, uh, you know, showcase the frauds, uh, the suspicious users.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: We will now move onto the second half of the interview. This section of the interview will consist of a case study based on your present work experience. Are you ready to start? 


Interviewee: Yes. Present work experience, yes, scenario. Right? So let me tell you about the personal work experience case scenario that so so clear. You want my personal work experience. Right? Work experience. So let me tell you one thing. So case study about the advertisements. As a data science associated with Nanon Shookart, I was tasked with integrating general TI technologies into various project enhance their functionalities and effectiveness. Yeah. This case very focused on integrating integration of the technologies into key projects addressing security vulnerabilities and the development of a bot virtual call air pilot scenario. Let's take an scenario for generative technology. So the background that includes, Linux Software is a leading venture builder with a focus of leveraging cutting edge technologies with ad driven innovation across its portfolios. The company identified an opportunity to enhance several key projects by integrating Gen AI technologies. These projects include intent probe, kill like, kill skill points, which aims to empower user engagement and operational efficiency. Challenges that security vulnerabilities. One of the primary challenge was addressing a prompt injection attack on the open interpreter is a VC business intelligence tool, which posts a significant security risk. We are coming to scalability, ensuring the AI driven solutions, would scale effectively to handle increasing user demand, which are comprising performance. Integration. Seamlessly integrating the AI solution with existing system to optimize functionality and performance. Key object use, integrate general UI technology, the key projects address and mitigate security vulnerabilities of the interpreter. Develop and implement virtual AI for Agilisys. So the final steps include the action that has been taken by the scenario for integrated Genia Technology to end up building like an skill points. The tech specs are the technologies that we use to leverage advanced models such as open edge, g p t 3 for natural language processing and OpenEdge which will first be to text conversion implementation, develop the new features and functionalities such as automated intent recognition, direct queries, and skill assessment tools using general AI models. Addressing security vulnerabilities, the issues of modifications that were identified from the injection attacks are the major vulnerabilities that open up the tool The solution that was implemented almost to input validation and sanitizers and techniques stream ticket, stop prompting the external tags, then the severe security testing. Conducted through security testing to ensure that implemented measure were effective and did not introduce new development of virtual call AI for HLS is the objective was to develop an ad driven virtual assistant to handle customer calls and provide a fixed efficient support. Technologies use their OpenAI API OpenAI Vistra model, then 11 Labs API. OpenAI API, you were used for? Database communication to facilitate natural language instructions. Open a base store model. I have implemented it for accuracy through text conversion enabling the words assistant to understand and respond to voice commands. The 11 Lapse API used for processing text data to speech enhancing the assistant ability to communicate effectively with users. So implementation steps where data integration AI training, and deployment. The data integration. Integrated virtual assistant with Agileys's existing customer database and support Then the virtual assistant, you know, historical call data to improve understanding of common queries and issues, deploy in the virtual assistant and cloud in project as your instances. And puts broader functionality, enhance security. This so the successful integration of Genesee Tech College into projects of Glenam Shaul could demonstrate the potential of AI to drive innovation and enhance functionality across various applications. By addressing security vulnerabilities and developing efficient addressable solution. We were able to deliver significant values to investigate and to its client. This case really highlights my ability to leverage advanced technologies address complex challenges, and deliver impactful results in a dynamic work environment. That's it.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Hi there! I'm John, and I'll be conducting your technical interview today. Could you please provide a brief overview of the project you worked on at Ciena, specifically focusing on the challenges you faced and how you overcame them?  


Interviewee: Yes. So for Incyte, I have worked on a project called Blue Planet, which manages infrastructure communications of, Ciena Hardware. And as a software company, throughout the world. So the there are many many challenges that I faced and I have resolved them. One of them is application monitoring. And there was a high throttling going on the application, how to monitor the application I have used Prometheus and Grafana to create dashboard. And monitor, any JBO spikes or any HTTP request spike, following that, we were able to scale the application properly. This was the first thing we saw. Following that, the second thing is trace IDs. So I I I have developed the x-ray tracing feature in Ciena whereby in multiple, microservices, if a request flows through, would become tough to find out in case if there is a error in one of the service for that request. So to pinpoint that error and to trace out the location of of the error, I have developed a tracing using which we can do that. Moreover, I've also developed, a waterfall tracing mechanism recently whereby you can see how much time each request is being processed by each, multi service. For example, if a request close to 4 microservices, so the in the first microservice, say, it took around 500 milliseconds. The second, 2 50 millisecond. In the third, 7 50 millisecond. So overall, we can see if it takes around 2 seconds to complete one request, Where is the point of improvement for the mic for the request in the microservice? Those things I have I've done.

Could you please provide a brief overview of the project you worked on at Ciena, specifically focusing on the challenges you faced and how you overcame them?  


Interviewee: Yes. So for Incyte, I have worked on a project called Blue Planet, which manages infrastructure communications of, Ciena Hardware. And as a software company, throughout the world. So the there are many many challenges that I faced and I have resolved them. One of them is application monitoring. And there was a high throttling going on the application, how to monitor the application I have used Prometheus and Grafana to create dashboard. And monitor, any JBO spikes or any HTTP request spike, following that, we were able to scale the application properly. This was the first thing we saw. Following that, the second thing is trace IDs. So I I I have developed the x-ray tracing feature in Ciena whereby in multiple, microservices, if a request flows through, would become tough to find out in case if there is a error in one of the service for that request. So to pinpoint that error and to trace out the location of of the error, I have developed a tracing using which we can do that. Moreover, I've also developed, a waterfall tracing mechanism recently whereby you can see how much time each request is being processed by each, multi service. For example, if a request close to 4 microservices, so the in the first microservice, say, it took around 500 milliseconds. The second, 2 50 millisecond. In the third, 7 50 millisecond. So overall, we can see if it takes around 2 seconds to complete one request, Where is the point of improvement for the mic for the request in the microservice? Those things I have I've done.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 7632, 2045, 999, 1045, 1005, 1049, 2198, 1010, 1998, 1045, 1005, 2222, 2022, 9283, 2115, 4087, 4357, 2651, 1012, 2071, 2017, 3531, 3073, 1037, 4766, 19184, 1997, 1996, 2622, 2017, 2499, 2006, 2012, 25022, 8189, 1010, 4919, 7995, 2006, 1996, 7860, 2017, 4320, 1998, 2129, 2017, 26463, 2068, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 2748, 1012, 2061, 2005, 4297, 17250, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2499, 2006, 1037, 2622, 2170, 2630, 4774, 1010, 2029, 9020, 6502, 4806, 1997, 1010, 25022, 8189, 8051, 1012, 1998, 2004, 1037, 4007, 2194, 1010, 2802, 1996, 2088, 1012, 2061, 1996, 2045, 2024, 2116, 2116, 7860, 2008, 1045, 4320, 1998, 1045, 2031, 10395, 2068, 1012, 2028, 1997, 2068, 2003, 4646, 8822, 1012, 1998, 2045, 2001, 1037, 2152, 16215, 21709, 15073, 2183, 2006, 1996, 4646, 1010, 2129, 2000, 8080, 1996, 4646, 1045, 2031, 2109, 20877, 11031, 10600, 1998, 22160, 5162, 2000, 3443, 24923, 1012, 1998, 8080, 1010, 2151, 1046, 5092, 19547, 2030, 2151, 8299, 5227, 9997, 1010, 2206, 2008, 1010, 2057, 2020, 2583, 2000, 4094, 1996, 4646, 7919, 1012, 2023, 2001, 1996, 2034, 2518, 2057, 2387, 1012, 2206, 2008, 1010, 1996, 2117, 2518, 2003, 7637, 8909, 2015, 1012, 2061, 1045, 1045, 1045, 2031, 2764, 1996, 1060, 1011, 4097, 16907, 3444, 1999, 25022, 8189, 13557, 1999, 3674, 1010, 12702, 8043, 7903, 2229, 1010, 2065, 1037, 5227, 6223, 2083, 1010, 2052, 2468, 7823, 2000, 2424, 2041, 1999, 2553, 2065, 2045, 2003, 1037, 7561, 1999, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2326, 2005, 2008, 5227, 1012, 2061, 2000, 9231, 8400, 2008, 7561, 1998, 2000, 7637, 2041, 1996, 3295, 1997, 1997, 1996, 7561, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2764, 1037, 16907, 2478, 2029, 2057, 2064, 2079, 2008, 1012, 9308, 1010, 1045, 1005, 2310, 2036, 2764, 1010, 1037, 14297, 16907, 7337, 3728, 13557, 2017, 2064, 2156, 2129, 2172, 2051, 2169, 5227, 2003, 2108, 13995, 2011, 2169, 1010, 4800, 2326, 1012, 2005, 2742, 1010, 2065, 1037, 5227, 2485, 2000, 1018, 12702, 8043, 7903, 2229, 1010, 2061, 1996, 1999, 1996, 2034, 12702, 8043, 7903, 2063, 1010, 2360, 1010, 2009, 2165, 2105, 3156, 4971, 5562, 8663, 5104, 1012, 1996, 2117, 1010, 1016, 2753, 4971, 5562, 8663, 2094, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2353, 1010, 1021, 2753, 4971, 5562, 8663, 2094, 1012, 2061, 3452, 1010, 2057, 2064, 2156, 2065, 2009, 3138, 2105, 1016, 3823, 2000, 3143, 2028, 5227, 1010, 2073, 2003, 1996, 2391, 1997, 7620, 2005, 1996, 23025, 2005, 1996, 5227, 1999, 1996, 12702, 8043, 7903, 2063, 1029, 2216, 2477, 1045, 2031, 1045, 1005, 2310, 2589, 1012, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your use of multi-threading and asynchronous processing in Python for data manipulation is quite innovative. Shifting focus to a different aspect of your technical skills, you've listed Django as one of your primary skills. Can you describe a particularly complex feature you've implemented in a Django project and the specific challenges you faced with it?  

Interviewee: Have built a lot of complex systems in Django. Uh, I was responsible for in a start up to build APIs of back end, uh, to handle ecommerce related products and orders at the same time, which, uh, orders talking about orders and the customer that place orders are very prone to getting errors and things like that, and we can't we can't, uh, afford that. So I have implemented implemented APIs using Django REST Frameworks to build and handle this. We have used Shopify, Ocommerce, and Wix API integrations. I have done the integration of, uh, FreshTask work FreshDesk workers and the tickets to implement. If if a user is having any complaint, then it should get properly registered. And, uh, talking about, uh, the this one complex problem that, uh, I encountered was a product tagging mechanism where we had few where we had a list of 500 to 1000 keywords on the basis of which we were trying to tag our products to recommend, uh, users what kind of product they are looking for. So I used to postgreSQL v vectors to to manage to make these, uh, small small tags and then integrate it with our Python script Python project to handle them via API. So if a user is trying to buy, let's say, a shirt of blue color, then we will, uh, again recommend it with a different shirt that is also a blue color or a color that resembles with blue. So the post SQL v vectors and the natural language processing of how, uh, our our mind analyze what when we see a word and how we can match it with other products helped a lot, and we have developed that using our Django project. The use of Django

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: How do you intend to continue improving the system, given that you've already implemented the JSON conversion and seen the resulting decrease in data retrieval times?  


Interviewee: Okay. So for further improvement that we can see that, uh, yeah. So every time, currently, it is hitting to the database. Right? So if it it is something that a lot of users are, uh, hitting to the same index, then we can use for go for the cache methodology. So that cache, we can store the, uh, us a data that is continuously retrieved by the users. So that will reduce a lot of time, uh, because don't need to go to the database because database hit is always a cost, uh, costly operation. So cache is the one thing that, uh, if any in future, we need to improve this, uh, efficiency, then we can go for the cache 1.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach. Given the complexity of merging data from various sources, how did you ensure the consistency and accuracy of the data, especially when transforming it into a single format using Power Query?  

Interviewee: Yeah. So accuracy of the data was the, uh, one of the biggest compliance, uh, for our organization. Uh, when we collect the data, the source we we make sure the source is authentic. So in North America, we collected their data from only government sources, uh, not the 3rd party sources. So government, uh, sources always have the correct and unique data. And for that reason, uh, we believe then that we'll we trusted the data sources, and, uh, we mix we have reviewed the data after collecting, uh, and making them into a single format. We have peer reviewed our work so that the data can be, uh, data can be merged in a concise format, also in a accurate format. So that's how we have made made sure that it's the data we collected is authentic, accurate, and, uh, we we can fit that toward, uh, software.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Automating the issue analysis with Python scripts is a smart way to improve efficiency. Using pandas for data manipulation and either Matplotlib or Bokeh for visualization is a solid approach. Given your experience with automation, can you tell me about a time when you used RPA (UiPath) in your projects, and how it benefited the process or workflow you were working on?  

Interviewee: Yeah. So that RPA skill I've used during my final year mini project, not the main project. So during my 7 sem, I used in the mini project. So at that time, only the RPA was exist, like, at 2021. It was like RPA was new technology. So I just wanted to learn and, first approach I went through is like in the Google means in the basically in the web, I just gone through what this RPA and how it works. Then I came to understanding it is almost like a AI and machine learning. It is it is completely to do with the flowcharts. So it is, like, complete, we have a flowchart. So inside the flowchart, we will be giving the condition. So that's how RPA will work. So that is also almost related to the automation. So it which will reduce the manual effect because everything will be feed feeded in, uh, flowchart, and it will loop in the, uh, means it will run-in the loop. So that is how RPA works. So whatever the input we are feeding and whatever the flow we are mentioning the flowchart, it will run-in a loop. So by using that, what application I have created I have not created application. So, basically, it's like just a approach, and I have not, uh, released anywhere. So the approach which I made is for, basically, for the travel application. So in travel applications, we know we are booking hotel for the specific places. So what the application which I developed will do is, like, in that within the travel app, we can have this app UA interface. So what it does is it will take the city name as input from the user. For example, if I am giving, like, Chennai or USA or Tokyo or Japan, whatever the input, it will take that input. And how the flowchart has been made is take the city input, go to the web by using the web scrapper, then put, uh, type that, uh, input whatever the user given and take the current temperature and the current, uh, whatever the weather is. So that it will take and it will store internally. So all the coding done here is, uh, based on the vb.net. So vb.net only we have used for the RPA coding. So after taking these two inputs, it will go to the condition flow. In condition flow, whatever we are given is, for example, the temperature is between this to this or whether it's between this to this, then pop up this message to the user interface. So the complete it is like a very simple project, but just user friendly. So take a input from the, uh, user. So, for example, I'm giving Chennai. Then it will go on scrap from the web. So the temperature will be displaying. So the final output is like whatever the city name user has given, then whatever the temperature currently it is there at that city for the user entered, then whatever the weather there is. So based on the temperature and weather, it will also suggest which type of clothes we can pack for our travel. So which will be almost helpful for everyone whenever they plan for any traveling for the sudden immediate plans.

So which will be almost helpful for everyone whenever they plan for any traveling for the sudden immediate plans.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 8285, 18900, 2075, 1996, 3277, 4106, 2007, 18750, 14546, 2003, 1037, 6047, 2126, 2000, 5335, 8122, 1012, 2478, 25462, 2015, 2005, 2951, 16924, 1998, 2593, 13523, 24759, 4140, 29521, 2030, 8945, 3489, 2232, 2005, 5107, 3989, 2003, 1037, 5024, 3921, 1012, 2445, 2115, 3325, 2007, 19309, 1010, 2064, 2017, 2425, 2033, 2055, 1037, 2051, 2043, 2017, 2109, 1054, 4502, 1006, 21318, 15069, 1007, 1999, 2115, 3934, 1010, 1998, 2129, 2009, 19727, 1996, 2832, 2030, 2147, 12314, 2017, 2020, 2551, 2006, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 3398, 1012, 2061, 2008, 1054, 4502, 8066, 1045, 1005, 2310, 2109, 2076, 2026, 2345, 2095, 7163, 2622, 1010, 2025, 1996, 2364, 2622, 1012, 2061, 2076, 2026, 1021, 7367, 2213, 1010, 1045, 2109, 1999, 1996, 7163, 2622, 1012, 2061, 2012, 2008, 2051, 1010, 2069, 1996, 1054, 4502, 2001, 4839, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2012, 25682, 1012, 2009, 2001, 2066, 1054, 4502, 2001, 2047, 2974, 1012, 2061, 1045, 2074, 2359, 2000, 4553, 1998, 1010, 2034, 3921, 1045, 2253, 2083, 2003, 2066, 1999, 1996, 8224, 2965, 1999, 1996, 10468, 1999, 1996, 4773, 1010, 1045, 2074, 2908, 2083, 2054, 2023, 1054, 4502, 1998, 2129, 2009, 2573, 1012, 2059, 1045, 2234, 2000, 4824, 2009, 2003, 2471, 2066, 1037, 9932, 1998, 3698, 4083, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2009, 2003, 3294, 2000, 2079, 2007, 1996, 4834, 7507, 21217, 1012, 2061, 2009, 2003, 1010, 2066, 1010, 3143, 1010, 2057, 2031, 1037, 4834, 7507, 5339, 1012, 2061, 2503, 1996, 4834, 7507, 5339, 1010, 2057, 2097, 2022, 3228, 1996, 4650, 1012, 2061, 2008, 1005, 1055, 2129, 1054, 4502, 2097, 2147, 1012, 2061, 2008, 2003, 2036, 2471, 3141, 2000, 1996, 19309, 1012, 2061, 2009, 2029, 2097, 5547, 1996, 6410, 3466, 2138, 2673, 2097, 2022, 5438, 5438, 2098, 1999, 1010, 7910, 1010, 4834, 7507, 5339, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2097, 7077, 1999, 1996, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2965, 2009, 2097, 2448, 1011, 1999, 1996, 7077, 1012, 2061, 2008, 2003, 2129, 1054, 4502, 2573, 1012, 2061, 3649, 1996, 7953, 2057, 2024, 8521, 1998, 3649, 1996, 4834, 2057, 2024, 18625, 1996, 4834, 7507, 5339, 1010, 2009, 2097, 2448, 1011, 1999, 1037, 7077, 1012, 2061, 2011, 2478, 2008, 1010, 2054, 4646, 1045, 2031, 2580, 1045, 2031, 2025, 2580, 4646, 1012, 2061, 1010, 10468, 1010, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2066, 2074, 1037, 3921, 1010, 1998, 1045, 2031, 2025, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2207, 5973, 1012, 2061, 1996, 3921, 2029, 1045, 2081, 2003, 2005, 1010, 10468, 1010, 2005, 1996, 3604, 4646, 1012, 2061, 1999, 3604, 5097, 1010, 2057, 2113, 2057, 2024, 21725, 3309, 2005, 1996, 3563, 3182, 1012, 2061, 2054, 1996, 4646, 2029, 1045, 2764, 2097, 2079, 2003, 1010, 2066, 1010, 1999, 2008, 2306, 1996, 3604, 10439, 1010, 2057, 2064, 2031, 2023, 10439, 25423, 8278, 1012, 2061, 2054, 2009, 2515, 2003, 2009, 2097, 2202, 1996, 2103, 2171, 2004, 7953, 2013, 1996, 5310, 1012, 2005, 2742, 1010, 2065, 1045, 2572, 3228, 1010, 2066, 1010, 12249, 2030, 3915, 2030, 5522, 2030, 2900, 1010, 3649, 1996, 7953, 1010, 2009, 2097, 2202, 2008, 7953, 1012, 1998, 2129, 1996, 4834, 7507, 5339, 2038, 2042, 2081, 2003, 2202, 1996, 2103, 7953, 1010, 2175, 2000, 1996, 4773, 2011, 2478, 1996, 4773, 15121, 4842, 102]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: It's impressive that you've handled such a high volume of transactions and maintained security through encryption. Given your experience with third-party integrations, how did you handle error handling and logging to ensure that you could quickly identify and resolve any issues that arose with these integrations?  

Interviewee: Extensive logging mechanisms and exception handling frameworks to make sure that any kind of exceptions, if they were getting popping up, we would be immediately notified, uh, about that. So first thing which I did was, uh, implemented proper logging, and whatever logs I had put in the code base where I would be able to monitor them through Amazon's AWS CloudWatch. The other thing which I did was I also configured CloudWatch alarms, which would basically get triggered. For example, if there were a certain number of failures occurring in a certain period of time. For example, say there are more than 5 failures occurring within a time span of 1 hour. So that means that is definitely something wrong with the 3rd party vendor we are using, and a lot of API calls have been failing from their end. So, uh, simple CloudWatch alarm would be triggered for which the on call or the tech support which was, uh, deployed from Amazon would get notified of it, and then internally, the developers would then get notified by the ringing of the CloudWatch alarm, and then we would further look and, uh, debug of the issue. So those are some of the configurations we took in place for, uh, I took in place for handling errors and configuring alarms to get notified of such, uh, acceptance scenarios. That's a solid approach to

Interviewer: Good points on the scaling and data management challenges. What do you think would be the potential impact or benefits of successfully implementing this anomaly detection system for the e-commerce platform? 


Interviewee: Yeah. The benefits would be, like, they can, directly in real time, they can see what all things are causing these anomalies, like and they can take an action. Stop this from happening or to stop those users who are basically doing certain kinds of activities. Right? They can set up certain rules. The different ways would be, like, cost. You are spending some amount of money here to basically make this, project head. And, it's like an experiment. You basically may not able to find 100% of an omnidirectional since it's a model that is dummy. It's, like, 90, 80% accurate in real time that you can see. Still the 20% work is left to wait for the model to keep on, learning and learning. So these are the drawbacks that I would see. Yeah. That's it.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's move on to a case study style problem. Imagine you are tasked with developing a real-time monitoring system for an autonomous vehicle fleet. The system needs to collect and process data from various sensors (e.g., LIDAR, cameras, GPS) in real-time, ensuring low latency and high reliability. The data should be transmitted to a central server for further analysis and decision-making. Could you propose a high-level solution architecture or approach to tackle this problem? 


Interviewee: Of course, that the thing about the overall architecture First of all, I need to create, high level solution architectures I mean, firstly, sensor data occlusion, for example. Sensor should be involved. For example, these are cameras, GPS, and other vehicle sensors. That should be also, microcontroller. Each vehicle is equipped with with powerful microcontroller or system on chip that interfaces with sensor. I need also communication protocols I need to utilize protocols like I2C, API, or WART 4. Sensor data creation. Secondly, I need age processing actually. You know, I need preprocessing unit implement, preprocessing on microcontrollers to filter, compress, and encode data. This reduces the data and extract relevant feature. And also implement real time data processing. I need to use, like, using real time operating system like training for VXworks for managing real time data processing tasks employ parallel processing techniques where possible. Thirdly, data aggregation and local structures. Storage is needed. I need I need to agree to data from different sensor and store it temporarily in local storage. I need to implement a buffer management system to handle burst data and ensure smooth data flow. 4 4thly, I need communication, as I said. I need network protocol, actually. I change TCP IP or, UDP over cellular or dedicated vehicle networks for communication with the central server. I need to also ensure about low latency and reliable data transmission using techniques like data packet priority or quality of service management I need sense of server infrastructure also. I mean, I need to set up a scalable server, class to handle incoming data streams from the vehicle fleet. And it use high throughput data acquisition tools like Apache Kafka to manage real time data stream. Finally, I need to monitor and visualize this. I mean, can develop a centralized dashboard using tools like Grafana or Kibana to visualize real time data alerts and systems that use. And it also implement alarm system. I mean, I need to implement the alert system to notify operator of critical illness or anomalies in the vehicle fleets. So by following this architecture, the system can efficiently collect process, and transport sensor data from an autonomous vehicle fleet in real time, ensuring low latency higher reliability, and scalable data management for effective decision making.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: It seems there might be a connection issue. I'll repeat the question for you. Can you explain how Java's Garbage Collection works, and what strategies can be employed to optimize it in a large-scale application?  

Interviewee: Uh, certainly, uh, certainly in Java, uh, the garbage collection process is the automatically, uh, reclaiming the memory occupied by objects that are long no longer referenced by the application. Java garbage collector operates in the background, the managing memory allocation and the relocation with text split programmer intervention. Uh, some there are some garbage collection works. How he ran so that is a memory allocation, reference tracking, and garbage collection process, and memory compaction and to optimize the garbage collection in a larger scale application. Also, there are some steps to be, uh, strategies to be evolved with. There are choose the right garbage collector and tune garbage collection settings and minimize the object subtended creation and avoid object to retention and use big references, monitor and analyze garbage collection activity in user. So by these strategies, uh, we can optimize a garbage collection performance, uh, in larger scale in Java applicants by improving the throughout the process and, uh, the latency by the efficient effectively managing the memory issues.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's impressive, especially the transition to a multi-threaded environment for the checkpoint resiliency. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced while implementing this transition, particularly in terms of ensuring data consistency and handling potential concurrency issues?  

Interviewee: Sure. Uh, so the that was actually amongst the biggest problems that we had. Uh, so the checkpointing process, if you look at it, it is a process of 20 different processes as one. So all of these different processes used to execute synchronously 1 by 1. And as soon as one process is complete, it will go to the next process. In this particular aspect, if any one of the checkpoints in the middle fail, let's say out of 20, the first 15 pass and the 16th one fails, then the entire process used to be considered as failed, and we had to restart the process from beginning from point 1. So the first aspect was to make sure there was, uh, there was individuality between each checkpoint. So earlier, there was a heavy dependency between every checkpoint. So from a business perspective, we went back, and we made sure that every checkpoint was isolated from each other. So while doing this, we were able to do it up to, say, from 20, we were able to make it, uh, as 10 different checkpoints, and then the remaining 10, they were dependent on each other in some of the other way. So we made it into smaller batches of 3 3 to 2 checkpoints. And that way, we were able to make it into, say, 10 different 10 individual checkpoints and then a few, uh, batches of checkpoints. After that, what we did was, uh, we ran single threads. We ran new threads for starting each different batch and for starting each individual checkpoint. And in those cases, we, uh, definitely, we used synchronization and transactional, um, Spring Boot use cases wherein, uh, the synchronization was made sure. And, while doing this, in case there was any data inconsistency issue, what we mainly look for was data anatomy, uh, autonomy. Sorry. So what this makes sure is that if a particular piece of data is owned by a particular process or service, then we make sure that only that particular service is able to update it. So that way, we knew the updation of the service only depend updation of a data only depended on that particular service. So this made sure that whoever is reading the service was only able to read that data, and manipulation was only done by one part. So that way, we were able to achieve data consistency through, uh, making sure there's data autonomy. Uh, post that, we were able to add a resiliency aspect also to it. Uh, during this, what we did was we added retries during the checkpoint generation process. What this made sure was that, uh, let's say if a particular checkpoint failed, uh, if it did not fail because of a constant error, let's say if there's a null pointer exception or if there is a divide by most of the times, it would be like we are calling some external API. We would checkpoint because most of the times, it would be like we are calling some external API. We're getting data from there and then com computing it. So if that external call fails, we can just retry that particular checkpoint, get that data from that external call, and then retry the checkpoint. So because of this also, we we were able to achieve a good amount of efficiency in our project where earlier we used to see a lot of failures. Now that we had a retry, we were able to reduce the failures by a good 35 to 40% as well.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your approach to data preprocessing and model selection is quite thorough. Regarding the handling of missing values, how did you determine which method of imputation to use, and what led you to choose Random Forest over other algorithms in terms of its ability to handle the specific characteristics of your data?  


Interviewee: Uh, choosing the right model for an AI project involves a cystic systematic evolution of the problem, the data, and the desired outcomes. So, uh, the following steps to understand the data would be, uh, understand the problem domain. I start by clearing, defining the problem, and understand the type of task and whether it's classification, regression, clustering, or other type of analysis. Data exploration and preprocessing, I perform exploratory data analysis, uh, to understand the characteristics of the data. This includes checking for data distributions, identifying missing values, handling outliers, and understand future relationships. So feature selection and engineering based on the data exploration, I select the most relevant features and may create new features that can enhance the model's performance. Techniques like, uh, correlation analysis, principle compound component analysis, uh, can be used here. Um, I chose a set of candidate models based on the program type and the data characteristics. For example, uh, classification, uh, we chose logic a logistic regression random forest support vector machine gradient boosting neutral network. Regression, uh, we used linear regressions, decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting. So model in model evaluation, I train and evaluate these candidate models using appropriate metrics. For classification, I might use accuracy, precision, recall, f one score, and ROC, AUC. For regression metrics, like, uh, mean absolute error, mean squared error for clustering, uh, d v's bold index might be used. Cross validation and hyperparameter tuning. To ensure the model's robustness, I use techniques, uh, like k four cross validation. And, uh, Yeah. This is about the model selection for thoroughly.

However, there are notable inaccuracies and misapplications, such as 'cystic systematic evolution' and 'principle compound component analysis,' which should be 'systematic evaluation' and 'principal component analysis,' respectively. The response doesn't directly address the question about imputation methods or the specific choice of Random Forest, indicating a potential lack of deep understanding or ability to apply knowledge to specific scenarios. The level of technicality is somewhat inconsistent, and the response lacks depth in explaining the specific characteristics of the data that led to the choice of Random Forest. Overall, the candidate demonstrates a working knowledge of relevant methodologies and frameworks but does not provide concrete examples or deep insights into their decision-making process.",3,,,"Interviewer: Your approach to data preprocessing and model selection is quite thorough. Regarding the handling of missing values, how did you determine which method of imputation to use, and what led you to choose Random Forest over other algorithms in terms of its ability to handle the specific characteristics of your data?  


Interviewee: Uh, choosing the right model for an AI project involves a cystic systematic evolution of the problem, the data, and the desired outcomes. So, uh, the following steps to understand the data would be, uh, understand the problem domain. I start by clearing, defining the problem, and understand the type of task and whether it's classification, regression, clustering, or other type of analysis. Data exploration and preprocessing, I perform exploratory data analysis, uh, to understand the characteristics of the data. This includes checking for data distributions, identifying missing values, handling outliers, and understand future relationships. So feature selection and engineering based on the data exploration, I select the most relevant features and may create new features that can enhance the model's performance. Techniques like, uh, correlation analysis, principle compound component analysis, uh, can be used here. Um, I chose a set of candidate models based on the program type and the data characteristics. For example, uh, classification, uh, we chose logic a logistic regression random forest support vector machine gradient boosting neutral network. Regression, uh, we used linear regressions, decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting. So model in model evaluation, I train and evaluate these candidate models using appropriate metrics. For classification, I might use accuracy, precision, recall, f one score, and ROC, AUC. For regression metrics, like, uh, mean absolute error, mean squared error for clustering, uh, d v's bold index might be used. Cross validation and hyperparameter tuning. To ensure the model's robustness, I use techniques, uh, like k four cross validation. And, uh, Yeah. This is about the model selection for thoroughly.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2115, 3921, 2000, 2951, 17463, 3217, 9623, 7741, 1998, 2944, 4989, 2003, 3243, 16030, 1012, 4953, 1996, 8304, 1997, 4394, 5300, 1010, 2129, 2106, 2017, 5646, 2029, 4118, 1997, 17727, 26117, 2000, 2224, 1010, 1998, 2054, 2419, 2017, 2000, 5454, 6721, 3224, 2058, 2060, 13792, 1999, 3408, 1997, 2049, 3754, 2000, 5047, 1996, 3563, 6459, 1997, 2115, 2951, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 7910, 1010, 10549, 1996, 2157, 2944, 2005, 2019, 9932, 2622, 7336, 1037, 22330, 10074, 11778, 6622, 1997, 1996, 3291, 1010, 1996, 2951, 1010, 1998, 1996, 9059, 13105, 1012, 2061, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1996, 2206, 4084, 2000, 3305, 1996, 2951, 2052, 2022, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3305, 1996, 3291, 5884, 1012, 1045, 2707, 2011, 8430, 1010, 12854, 1996, 3291, 1010, 1998, 3305, 1996, 2828, 1997, 4708, 1998, 3251, 2009, 1005, 1055, 5579, 1010, 26237, 1010, 9324, 2075, 1010, 2030, 2060, 2828, 1997, 4106, 1012, 2951, 8993, 1998, 17463, 3217, 9623, 7741, 1010, 1045, 4685, 4654, 24759, 6525, 7062, 2951, 4106, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2000, 3305, 1996, 6459, 1997, 1996, 2951, 1012, 2023, 2950, 9361, 2005, 2951, 20611, 1010, 12151, 4394, 5300, 1010, 8304, 2041, 14355, 2015, 1010, 1998, 3305, 2925, 6550, 1012, 2061, 3444, 4989, 1998, 3330, 2241, 2006, 1996, 2951, 8993, 1010, 1045, 7276, 1996, 2087, 7882, 2838, 1998, 2089, 3443, 2047, 2838, 2008, 2064, 11598, 1996, 2944, 1005, 1055, 2836, 1012, 5461, 2066, 1010, 7910, 1010, 16902, 4106, 1010, 6958, 7328, 6922, 4106, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2064, 2022, 2109, 2182, 1012, 8529, 1010, 1045, 4900, 1037, 2275, 1997, 4018, 4275, 2241, 2006, 1996, 2565, 2828, 1998, 1996, 2951, 6459, 1012, 2005, 2742, 1010, 7910, 1010, 5579, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2057, 4900, 7961, 1037, 8833, 6553, 26237, 6721, 3224, 2490, 9207, 3698, 17978, 12992, 2075, 8699, 2897, 1012, 26237, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2057, 2109, 7399, 26237, 2015, 1010, 3247, 3392, 1010, 6721, 3224, 1998, 17978, 12992, 2075, 1012, 2061, 2944, 1999, 2944, 9312, 1010, 1045, 3345, 1998, 16157, 2122, 4018, 4275, 2478, 6413, 12046, 2015, 1012, 2005, 5579, 1010, 1045, 2453, 2224, 10640, 1010, 11718, 1010, 9131, 1010, 1042, 2028, 3556, 1010, 1998, 21326, 1010, 8740, 2278, 1012, 2005, 26237, 12046, 2015, 1010, 2066, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2812, 7619, 7561, 1010, 2812, 19942, 7561, 2005, 9324, 2075, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1040, 1058, 1005, 1055, 7782, 5950, 2453, 2022, 2109, 1012, 2892, 27354, 1998, 23760, 28689, 22828, 17372, 1012, 2000, 5676, 1996, 2944, 1005, 1055, 15873, 2791, 1010, 1045, 2224, 5461, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2066, 1047, 2176, 2892, 27354, 1012, 1998, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3398, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2055, 1996, 2944, 4989, 2005, 12246, 1012, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a very interesting feature, especially with the security considerations for temporary sessions. Given that you've also worked with NestJS and ReactJS, how do you compare the development experience between Loopback and NestJS, particularly in terms of ease of use, performance, and the ecosystem of available plugins and tools?  

Interviewee: In my honest opinion as chairs is a is a very much better framework than low back because let's just is much more modern. It takes advantage of dependence injection, which really reduces the workload on a developer where we don't have we don't really have to think about injecting the like making sure that dependencies are available or their instantiated for example, and the scoping of those of the classes because next year's dependence injection literally takes care of all those things so it is it is much more organized as well because the folder structure in the way. The folder structure is made it is it is automatically made sure that it is following a controller a module controller provider pattern so we don't have to build that from scratch either. So it is automatically implemented into the framework itself. Whereas and loopback is also in my opinion it is it is not really that modern either compared to nests. So I would say yes is a better framework mainly because of dependence injection because I really take advantage of that for creating things like Singleton classes where the database instance is shared across the entire application. Yeah, and also it also creates the models as well for databases and then the plugins in terms of plugins. uh, let's just really has overall better plug-in ecosystem because it officially supports things like type orm secularize.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Great! Let's start with your experience at Amazon. You mentioned developing an alternative to AWS RDS Data API. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced during this project and how you overcame them? 

Interviewee: Ma'am? Yes. Surely. So in Amazon, I was part of the p three p team, which is the premium third party sellers team. So all the seller data which came as an invoice to our system, so there was a difficulty in the end to end completeness of the data because of the Lambdas being triggered simultaneously. So it was a high concurrency database. And there was a problem because of throttling as the data was not able to be like, the database was not able to scale properly. So the problem was with the data API, which was being used to access this database. This was an AWS RDS database which was working on Aurora Postgres. So the problem was that data API, which is provided as the default way of connecting to the service by AWS, was not being able to handle this many concurrent requests As well as it has many time out issues. So we wanted to separate this and we wanted to write our own way of connecting to the database. So I was given this important task, and I went ahead with a deep dive of all the topics that had been creating problems in this, uh, in this specific challenge, and I went ahead and did a deep dive of all the repositories of our team to understand how we are actually connecting with the database and how we are configuring everything. So after that, I went ahead and designed a JDBC connection pool spring data JPA, which is one of the I took up the spring data JPA, which is one of the, uh, ways provided by the spring application suite of Java and we wrote our own code to connect to the database and provided an an alternative to the AWS RDS data API. So this was the important project, and this has a direct positive customer impact as now the vendors and sellers of Amazon are all able to see their end to end complete invoice data, and there is no mismatch and there is no gaps in the data. So this is the challenge that I overtook, and I successfully completed it.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your approach to securing gRPC communication, starting from the network level with SSH restrictions and then leveraging the inherent security of gRPC over HTTP/2, is quite thorough. Could you detail how you would implement custom authentication and authorization mechanisms in a gRPC service, perhaps using examples with Golang?  

Interviewee: Okay. Uh, in gRPC, we have this option of, uh, with insecure. So in with insecure, we don't have to provide any credential. It can be used without context and without security or for local development. But when we are using, uh, for production level, we this approach is not good. Other than that, where we will provide a header in the header, we will provide, uh, our token, which will be the JWT token, which will be verified at the back end or the, uh, other service that is running it. And, uh, it's based on the client. Uh, okay. Okay. So it will also point point, okay, this request should only be coming from this microservices. So this is the way we usually, uh, follow the authentication of user and how it will be used in gRPC. Along with that, we have the token which is being passed along with that. Okay. It's my main service. Let's say it's a client service which is receiving the request from the web app. Then this service will be saying, okay, token is validated or not, and it will pass the request to, let's say, order services. And their order services also, it will, uh, check, okay, this token is valid or not. They're using caching caching mechanism, which is being available to both the, uh, client API as well as the order order API service. So this is how we handle the authentication between different services. Your

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your approach to handling responsiveness and performance optimization is quite thorough. Now, considering your strong background in competitive programming, how do you think this has influenced your approach to web development, particularly in terms of algorithmic efficiency and code optimization?  


Interviewee: Yeah. So yeah. Definitely. Uh, completely programming definitely helped me um, boost the boost the overall experience in the web design. So so it definitely gives my, uh, problem solving skills, uh, by requiring the participants to tackle the complex algorithm challenge and constraints. This mindset translates well in where I approach problems methodically and consider various solutions before implementing the most efficient one. Also, the competitive programming emphasizing algorithm thinking, which involves breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems and identifying patterns and optimization opportunities. This mindset helps me design efficient algorithms and data structures when building web applications. In computing programming, optimizing code for speed and memory usage is crucial for achieving better performance and higher ranking. Similarly, in web development, optimizing code and algorithms for efficiency is essential for improving website performance, reducing the load times, and enhancing user experiences. Completely Broadband exposes participants to a wide range of data structures and algorithm. You can do arrays, link list, tree, short end algorithms, dynamic programming techniques. This knowledge is directly applicable to web development where I leverage these data structures and algorithms to solve problem efficiently and effectively. At last, the cognitive programming involves analyzing the time and space of the algorithms to evaluate their performance. This analytical mindset help me assess performance of web applications, identify bottlenecks, and optimize critical sections of the code to improve overall efficiency and scalability. So, uh, definitely, my background in community programming has equipped me with valuable skills and strategies that enhance my approach to the web development.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Utilizing try-catch-finally for error handling and process management is a robust practice. How did you ensure that sensitive data, like error details or partial data, is not inadvertently exposed to users in case of an error?  

Interviewee: so since the error data has done doesn't have to be exposed to the user. So this can be handled by if we use something such as the EnV file like environment variables. Like if we entirely want that the system should be so secured that nothing has to be popped up even at I think given amount of Any Given period of time so we can use environment variables. Whereas we can store the in the error message in the environment variable and you can directly use the variables over in the error block of the catch in the in the in the catch block where we try to catch the errors. So if we directly use the environment variables so that way the it will be very secured. The error messages will be very secured wouldn't get leaked anywhere because the environment variables are way too hide specific matters for specific pieces of information that doesn't have to be leaked to the public. So yeah environment variables can be used or to implement this


","{'expertise': {'justification': ""The candidate's response demonstrates a limited understanding of error handling and data security practices. While they mention using environment variables, which is somewhat relevant, they misapply this concept to error message storage rather than configuration.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your explanation provides a clear understanding of how DevOps facilitates integration and continuous testing in a multi-system environment. Given the critical role of DevOps in your strategy, could you elaborate on how you specifically managed the cultural and organizational changes required to adopt DevOps within your teams, especially considering the large team size and the distributed nature of your operations?  


Interviewee: Yeah, definitely. So I this question is a specific related to how we have dealt with the cultural and you know issues maybe when we are, you know working in a very big and last ice team in a devops kind of culture. So definitely see when the team is very big in size and especially when the team is a global team. Okay. So maybe one team is sitting at the USA another team will be seating at in India and 13 would be sitting in Russia, maybe or some other country maybe in China or maybe in Australia. So all the time zones are very different for prospective teams, or wish who all are working. So let's say one team is who is setting there in USA or responsible for the front end activities. Another team who is setting here in India are is responsible for a database development activity or related to you know their Enablement with the database and enhancement of the data schema or the details. So so these are the two teams they are working or there are different other teams who are working different, you know different parts of the country. So this is a scenario. Which I'm taking to explain how the people will be working and how I used to communicate it and how I have handled things in a similar way. So when these schemes are available over here, let's say at one part of time when these team are working. So they are working using a devops technology. So let's say the front end people who will be coming in they will be doing their job when they are logging in. Let's say if it is in the night when the people are not available in the You know in India so definitely there would be some there would be some people who we can keep, you know at the handshake time. That's it. For example the people from one time zone. Would be available for maybe two to three hours of time for the people of another time zone. Okay, so we can make the people available in both or all these times on so that the people who are actually working together or the team who are actually working together or they want to discuss any issues or that they can discuss their issues with those one or two of time frame and I believe for any of the activities or any of the discussion. Good discussion to be happen a handshake of one to two hours would be sufficient enough to discuss all the difficulties and to to discuss on the action points to overcome with those difficulties and to come up with the solution. So there will be the next day. So so during the handshake time, they will be discussing in within one or two hours of time frame about the solution and rest of the time on their own time. They will be focusing on on implementing those Solutions and let's say if they come across any other difficulties, then definitely they will be able to discuss this into their Their another you know handshake and the subsequent handshake meeting in the next day. So this is how this things usually happens. And at the same time it is very very important that the communication is still of each and every team members needs to be taken care like we it is when I was there as a handling as a Distillery manager every month. I used to see if there is any person who is joint. He should be able to attend a communication skills so that the training communication is still trading so that he should be aware of what all things needs to be taken care while communicating to the people of the different part of the country which all the words we should be using when we are working with the Who are situated at the at the different country or the different time zone which all words we should not be using and how we should be focusing directly on to work and how we should how we will be more productive using our communication when we are asking what are the right questions. We are asking to our counterparts with sitting, you know different part of the world, which can make the time valuable and efficient forI'm efficiently so that we do not waste somebody's else time to explaining the things and that's the reason the asking the right question is very very much important using a very clear communication when we are working especially working in a different, you know, the time zone and a different with a different cultural cultural aspects and mixed match within the team. So these are the few aspects where I have handled and also there are different ways of handling conflict within two or three teams. This comes into picture. Let's say if something if there has been any conflict between two the people who are working on two times two different times zones or in the same time zone and definitely we have to handle all those kind of conflicts in that way in a very very You know objective way that that objectively so that whatever things which will be coming up. It should not hamper the work or the task of the project and it could satisfy the demand of all the people who are involved into it. So these are all and also it gives not only satisfied anymore, but it gives the focused track path to the people like how they should be moving. Forward, you know after overcoming all these impediments and this, you know difficulties while you know dealing with things. Among them. So this is how it is. It creates an effective, you know, a mix of cultural enablement along with the devops. Let's say devops or any kind of mechanism. We are setting in or we are putting in so this is how I used to deal with Thank you.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Focusing on the YOLO algorithm's implementation for object detection in your food classification project, could you elaborate on how you integrated YOLO with the existing TensorFlow and Keras model? Specifically, what challenges did you face in this integration and how were they addressed?  

Interviewee: Yes. YOLO stands for you only look once. So it is used for the single pass prediction and bounded box prediction and classes prediction. YOLO has a several versions like YOLO v 4, YOLO v 5. And, uh, I have used YOLO v 4 for the classes prediction of the food image dataset. The challenges I have placed here is, uh, so forgetting the accuracy. First, I have used CNN and n. I got only 85% accuracy. So then I shifted to YOLO. Here, I the challenges are we have to have a it is a huge dataset which contains 1 or 1 foot clashes with different type of images. So some images, maybe some random pixel and other images may be, uh, some other random pixel. So here, first of all, we have to adjust all the images in a correct pixel. Like, all the emails should have same pixel match. So that we should not, uh, we will not get any, uh, errors while running the data while running the dataset. YOLO weaver plays a crucial role in identifying the food classification along with the, uh, like, class predictions, and YOLO predicts the probability distribution, overall classes for each bounding box. This means that YOLA can detect multiple objects of different classes in a single image. So this is what I have.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: You've provided a detailed account of how you addressed the issue with state equality in the BLoC pattern by implementing Equatable for proper state comparison. Your approach to reviewing stream subscriptions, ensuring proper disposal, and integrating BLoCs across multiple screens with multi-Bloc providers shows a thorough understanding of managing state in complex UI flows. The use of mock data for testing and tools for monitoring stream values also demonstrates a disciplined approach to debugging. Given your experience with testing, can you describe your approach to testing BLoC logic, particularly how you handle asynchronous operations within your tests?  

Interviewee: Okay. Fine. So, uh, we have this, uh, uh, so for writing block asynchronous operations such as network request. So I want to ensure that your test covers various scenarios properly handle asynchronous behavior. So for that, like, uh, we can use, uh, Mockito. Mockito is for mocking dependencies, like, external dependencies, like, let's say, like, network lines or database interfaces. This allows you to control the behavior of these dependencies. Right? Then you can use test widgets. In Flutter, you can use test widgets like mokitore, mocktail to mock dependencies and test block integrations with the UI. Right? And then you can test stream output. So when testing asynchronous operation, verify that block emits the expected stream of states. Right? Use expect later, uh, function to assert on the output stream, uh, whether, uh, it verifies and that that it emits the correct state or not. And you can also handle stream delays. So let's say account for delays in asynchronous operations by using utilities like fake async or, uh, test widgets, pump, and settle. So this way, I think you can handle asynchronous operations. Or, also, you can test loading states, error handling states, like image loading states when async operations are in progress test, how your UI response to loading states. And then, uh, for testing error handling, uh, ensure that your block, uh, handles errors gracefully by mocking error responses from external dependencies. So you can test with different scenarios. You can test with real data, like, let's say, integration tests and all. So this way, uh, you can use block async operations, uh, thoroughly tested.

Your approach to reviewing stream subscriptions, ensuring proper disposal, and integrating BLoCs across multiple screens with multi-Bloc providers shows a thorough understanding of managing state in complex UI flows. The use of mock data for testing and tools for monitoring stream values also demonstrates a disciplined approach to debugging. Given your experience with testing, can you describe your approach to testing BLoC logic, particularly how you handle asynchronous operations within your tests?  

Interviewee: Okay. Fine. So, uh, we have this, uh, uh, so for writing block asynchronous operations such as network request. So I want to ensure that your test covers various scenarios properly handle asynchronous behavior. So for that, like, uh, we can use, uh, Mockito. Mockito is for mocking dependencies, like, external dependencies, like, let's say, like, network lines or database interfaces. This allows you to control the behavior of these dependencies. Right? Then you can use test widgets. In Flutter, you can use test widgets like mokitore, mocktail to mock dependencies and test block integrations with the UI. Right? And then you can test stream output.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your approach to addressing challenges in dynamic web applications, especially with regard to state management, performance optimization, and responsive design, is quite comprehensive. Given the complexity of managing application state, could you provide an example of how you've used useContext or useState in a particularly innovative or efficient way to solve a specific problem within your Resume Builder WebApp? How did this approach impact the overall performance or user experience of the application?  

Interviewee: So in the resume with the web app, I encountered a scenario where I needed to manage the users, selected resume template, and the data associated with it to across with, uh, data associated with it across multiple components efficiently. To address this, I leverage React, use context hook in an innovative way. Uh, so here's I our approach did. So I created a resume context to encamp encapsulate the state related to the selected resume template and the data associated with it. So the resume context provider component was responsible for initializing the initial set and providing it to the rest of the application via context. And state management within the resume context provider component, I utilize use state hook to manage the selected resume template and the associated data. So when the user selected a different template or made changes to the data, I updated the state by using set state method provided by the use state hook To also address the efficient access across components by using use context hook, I x access the resume state and methods to update it directly within child components, eliminating the need to pass props down multiple levels of component hierarchy.

So when the user selected a different template or made changes to the data, I updated the state by using set state method provided by the use state hook To also address the efficient access across components by using use context hook, I x access the resume state and methods to update it directly within child components, eliminating the need to pass props down multiple levels of component hierarchy.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2115, 3921, 2000, 12786, 7860, 1999, 8790, 4773, 5097, 1010, 2926, 2007, 7634, 2000, 2110, 2968, 1010, 2836, 20600, 1010, 1998, 26651, 2640, 1010, 2003, 3243, 7721, 1012, 2445, 1996, 11619, 1997, 6605, 4646, 2110, 1010, 2071, 2017, 3073, 2019, 2742, 1997, 2129, 2017, 1005, 2310, 2109, 2224, 8663, 18209, 2030, 3594, 12259, 1999, 1037, 3391, 9525, 2030, 8114, 2126, 2000, 9611, 1037, 3563, 3291, 2306, 2115, 13746, 12508, 4773, 29098, 1029, 2129, 2106, 2023, 3921, 4254, 1996, 3452, 2836, 2030, 5310, 3325, 1997, 1996, 4646, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 2061, 1999, 1996, 13746, 2007, 1996, 4773, 10439, 1010, 1045, 8567, 1037, 11967, 2073, 1045, 2734, 2000, 6133, 1996, 5198, 1010, 3479, 13746, 23561, 1010, 1998, 1996, 2951, 3378, 2007, 2009, 2000, 2408, 2007, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2951, 3378, 2007, 2009, 2408, 3674, 6177, 18228, 1012, 2000, 4769, 2023, 1010, 1045, 21155, 10509, 1010, 2224, 6123, 8103, 1999, 2019, 9525, 2126, 1012, 7910, 1010, 2061, 2182, 1005, 1055, 1045, 2256, 3921, 2106, 1012, 2061, 1045, 2580, 1037, 13746, 6123, 2000, 4372, 26468, 4372, 17695, 23722, 3686, 1996, 2110, 3141, 2000, 1996, 3479, 13746, 23561, 1998, 1996, 2951, 3378, 2007, 2009, 1012, 2061, 1996, 13746, 6123, 10802, 6922, 2001, 3625, 2005, 3988, 6026, 1996, 3988, 2275, 1998, 4346, 2009, 2000, 1996, 2717, 1997, 1996, 4646, 3081, 6123, 1012, 1998, 2110, 2968, 2306, 1996, 13746, 6123, 10802, 6922, 1010, 1045, 16462, 2224, 2110, 8103, 2000, 6133, 1996, 3479, 13746, 23561, 1998, 1996, 3378, 2951, 1012, 2061, 2043, 1996, 5310, 3479, 1037, 2367, 23561, 2030, 2081, 3431, 2000, 1996, 2951, 1010, 1045, 7172, 1996, 2110, 2011, 2478, 2275, 2110, 4118, 3024, 2011, 1996, 2224, 2110, 8103, 2000, 2036, 4769, 1996, 8114, 3229, 2408, 6177, 2011, 2478, 2224, 6123, 8103, 1010, 1045, 1060, 3229, 1996, 13746, 2110, 1998, 4725, 2000, 10651, 2009, 3495, 2306, 2775, 6177, 1010, 15349, 1996, 2342, 2000, 3413, 24387, 2091, 3674, 3798, 1997, 6922, 12571, 1012, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your explanation highlights the efficiency and modern approach of FastAPI. Given its reliance on Python type hints for request and response validation, how does FastAPI's use of type hints contribute to the overall reliability and maintainability of the codebase, especially in comparison to dynamic-typed frameworks like Flask?  


Interviewee: Okay. So for dynamic type frameworks, generally, if I get some sort of garbage input from the user, right, I'll have to write additional code, which might also break my structure. Uh, talking about structure, we use domain driven domain driven design approach, which is also called as DTT. So, uh, once I'm using that, I can separate my concern into some small packets. So initially, when we are building an application, it would be a monolith. Right? And my all, uh, isolation concerns are separated inside one particular folder where I can write my Pydantic validation right away over there. So this is one better thing other than Flask because in Flask, I'll have to write code inside my routes itself, which, uh, increases my code, and I don't get that level of modularity in my code as well. Uh, with by that tick using validations, uh, I can just create certain schemas, and I can directly leverage those schemas. And automatically, it will check for the types that it is already doing. And it also gives me much, uh, better confidence that, uh, if the data is not, uh, adhering to my type, right, then it is not gonna get processed, which I don't even have to waste time and write, basically. So it's all in built, and it's quite lightweight as well. And it's much fast, uh, as the name suggests itself. I get fast API. So it's kind of fast to write it and, uh, implement it as well. On top of it, whatever by the tech models I am giving dependency to for request and response object, it directly leverages, uh, docs or Swagger docs or redox and gives me documentation directly so that I don't even have to waste time on writing documentation as well. So that's why it's much better than other non typed, uh, applications like Flask or Django, where I have to manage what sort of data I am having, what sort of, uh, data types I need to deal with with my databases as well. And I have everything sorted via dependency injection. Also create, uh, my, uh, documents as well. Right? Documentation is a little bit of page taking process, and it also solves it. Right? So one bird, uh, one one store and 2 birds at a time. So it's much better.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a comprehensive solution, especially for handling scalability and cost efficiency. Given your experience with this, how did you manage the transactional integrity of the email sending process, particularly in the case of failures?  

Interviewee: So, uh, uh, definitely, uh, what I have said, uh, so email when I was sending an email, uh, to the, uh, designated, uh, vendor. So what I did, uh, let's say I make a temporary view table. I already have a temporary view. I make an entry of all the emails that I needed to send. Okay. And there will be a flags there, checks there. Key this has been sent or not. So it will be like let's say we have multiple statuses. Let's say it's in the pending status. So means it has been firstly stacked in the, uh, the temporary table that needed to be sent. Once that is picked, so status will be changed to processing state. Okay? But still it is not get the send. Okay. Once it gets sent, it will be marked as a send. So this way, I'm first maintaining it and definitely have used, uh, their, uh, Amazon SES. Any failure there, if it was happening, it will go in the retry mode. That also mechanism I have set to maximum 3 times, 4 times. Error log was also getting logged in different tables so that we can check if there is any new error is coming or any, uh, edge cases has come in. So, likewise, uh, everything was maintained.

So what I did, uh, let's say I make a temporary view table. I already have a temporary view. I make an entry of all the emails that I needed to send. Okay. And there will be a flags there, checks there. Key this has been sent or not. So it will be like let's say we have multiple statuses. Let's say it's in the pending status. So means it has been firstly stacked in the, uh, the temporary table that needed to be sent. Once that is picked, so status will be changed to processing state. Okay? But still it is not get the send. Okay. Once it gets sent, it will be marked as a send. So this way, I'm first maintaining it and definitely have used, uh, their, uh, Amazon SES. Any failure there, if it was happening, it will go in the retry mode. That also mechanism I have set to maximum 3 times, 4 times. Error log was also getting logged in different tables so that we can check if there is any new error is coming or any, uh, edge cases has come in. So, likewise, uh, everything was maintained.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2008, 1005, 1055, 1037, 7721, 5576, 1010, 2926, 2005, 8304, 26743, 8553, 1998, 3465, 8122, 1012, 2445, 2115, 3325, 2007, 2023, 1010, 2129, 2106, 2017, 6133, 1996, 12598, 2389, 11109, 1997, 1996, 10373, 6016, 2832, 1010, 3391, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 15428, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 2061, 1010, 7910, 1010, 7910, 1010, 5791, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2054, 1045, 2031, 2056, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 10373, 2043, 1045, 2001, 6016, 2019, 10373, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2000, 1996, 1010, 7910, 1010, 4351, 1010, 7910, 1010, 21431, 1012, 2061, 2054, 1045, 2106, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2292, 1005, 1055, 2360, 1045, 2191, 1037, 5741, 3193, 2795, 1012, 1045, 2525, 2031, 1037, 5741, 3193, 1012, 1045, 2191, 2019, 4443, 1997, 2035, 1996, 22028, 2008, 1045, 2734, 2000, 4604, 1012, 3100, 1012, 1998, 2045, 2097, 2022, 1037, 9245, 2045, 1010, 14148, 2045, 1012, 3145, 2023, 2038, 2042, 2741, 2030, 2025, 1012, 2061, 2009, 2097, 2022, 2066, 2292, 1005, 1055, 2360, 2057, 2031, 3674, 3570, 2229, 1012, 2292, 1005, 1055, 2360, 2009, 1005, 1055, 1999, 1996, 14223, 3570, 1012, 2061, 2965, 2009, 2038, 2042, 15847, 16934, 1999, 1996, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1996, 5741, 2795, 2008, 2734, 2000, 2022, 2741, 1012, 2320, 2008, 2003, 3856, 1010, 2061, 3570, 2097, 2022, 2904, 2000, 6364, 2110, 1012, 3100, 1029, 2021, 2145, 2009, 2003, 2025, 2131, 1996, 4604, 1012, 3100, 1012, 2320, 2009, 4152, 2741, 1010, 2009, 2097, 2022, 4417, 2004, 1037, 4604, 1012, 2061, 2023, 2126, 1010, 1045, 1005, 1049, 2034, 8498, 2009, 1998, 5791, 2031, 2109, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2037, 1010, 7910, 1010, 9733, 7367, 2015, 1012, 2151, 4945, 2045, 1010, 2065, 2009, 2001, 6230, 1010, 2009, 2097, 2175, 1999, 1996, 2128, 11129, 5549, 1012, 2008, 2036, 7337, 1045, 2031, 2275, 2000, 4555, 1017, 2335, 1010, 1018, 2335, 1012, 7561, 8833, 2001, 2036, 2893, 26618, 1999, 2367, 7251, 2061, 2008, 2057, 2064, 4638, 2065, 2045, 2003, 2151, 2047, 7561, 2003, 2746, 2030, 2151, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3341, 3572, 2038, 2272, 1999, 1012, 2061, 1010, 10655, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2673, 2001, 5224, 1012, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: I appreciate the context, but I'm specifically interested in the metrics you monitored and how you set thresholds to define normal and abnormal behavior in the system.  


Interviewee: Sure. Sure. Got it. So okay. So specific metrics that was monitor was transaction success rate, in which the percent of transaction that was successfully processed. Then error rate, the number of failed transaction over a period of categorized. By us using specific error codes, then response time, the time taken taken to process transaction from initiation to completion. Then throughput, the number of transaction process per second, then database performance, like query execution and time the data pay responses, then network latency, the time taken for data to travel from the user to back our server to back to our server. Then determining, how I determine normal versus abnormal behavior. Like, based on historical data and analyze historical performance data to establish baseline for normal behavior. For example, average response time during normal load versus speed load periods. Then we also improvised industry benchmark compared our metrics against industry standard, and the best practices to ensure our performance was within acceptable range. Then setting a threshold like alerting threshold was set by us, defined threshold for key metrics based on the established baseline. For example, setting a response time threshold for any transaction that is taking longer than 10 seconds. That will trigger an alert for us. Then dynamic threshold. Implement, that adjusted based on real time data. For example, allowing higher CPU usage during peak times. But alerting if it stayed high for an extended period of time. Then we were also doing real time monitoring using tools such as Datadope, to continuously monitor our meters in real time. Then alert configuration was made from us from our side on Datadog. Like, we created alert monitor on Datadog. Like, my development team created alert monitor for that particular APIs. So using that, we quickly address the potential issue before they impacted the users. That's all. And for ensuring, like, performance, we conducted testing using tools like Apache JMeter. This helped me identify the bottleneck and optimize the code for faster execution time. I also implemented caching mechanism along with my development team. Improve responses time for repeated user. Additionally, we use asynchronous processing for noncritical task to ensure that main transaction flow remain quick and responsive. So as a result of these effort, the integration significantly improved the perform platform transaction success rate that also improved by average time processing time of 30%. That's it.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Given the context of your Python application's pivot from a Java-based data loading and processing system to a more efficient Python and Java hybrid system, how did you ensure data integrity and accuracy throughout this transition, especially considering the reformatting and selective querying of data that occurred in the process?  

Interviewee: So, uh, this particular requirement was, uh, moved from one application to other in the form of CSV or Excel file, and that was a requirement of the operations user to get it in CSV file. So if the user requests the data of a certain column to be loaded from a certain specific time or on certain parameters, my Python application would get the request from the Java application. And once the data is generated, instead of sending it back to the Java application, it would curate it into a CSV file or an Excel file based on the input provided by the operations and send it directly in a zip folder on email to the specific user. That's how the entire processing was in place.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: How do you approach the challenge of securing user data in a web application, especially in terms of data encryption and access control?  


Interviewee: So securing user data with encryption and access controls, uh, involves about protecting sensitive information, uh, predictive sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. So data data encryption can be put to use or can be uh, can be made into play through data at rest, uh, data in transit, and end to end encryption. Data at rest, uh, involves interesting user data stored in the databases, file systems, and other storage system using strong encryption algorithms such as AES, advanced encryption standard, using in industry standard encryption libraries and tools to implement encryption securely. Data in transit, uh, encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers over network using protocols like HTTPS or for web applications or using t SSL TLS certificates to establish secure connections and prevent eavesdropping and data interception. End to end encryption, uh, protects data throughout its entire life cycle from the point of creation to storage and transmission. This ensures that only authorized parties can access the decrypted data. 2nd is by access control method. We, uh, we can provide authentication, authorization, principle of least privilege, audit trails and data masking and reduction. So 3rd is the secure key management. We can also follow this approach through key rotation, including a regular rotation of encryption fees to mitigate the risk of key compromise. Data loss prevention is the 4th method to monitor data loss prevention solutions to to monitor, detect, and prevent enterprise access or leakage of sensitive data. Regular security audit and assessment, conducting regular security and audit assessments by identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the encryption and access controls.



","{'expertise': {'justification': ""The candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of data security concepts, accurately using technical terms like AES, HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and end-to-end encryption. They provide a structured approach to securing user data, covering encryption at rest, in transit, and end-to-end, as well as access control methods. However, while the response shows breadth, it lacks depth in some areas. For instance, they mention 'principle of least privilege' without elaborating, and don't provide concrete examples of implementation. The level of technicality is appropriate for the question, but the response could benefit from more specific, real-world applications or challenges in implementing these security measures. Additionally, while the candidate's use of technical terminology is generally accurate, there are instances where terms are misused or used in the wrong context, such as 'predictive sensitive data,' which is not a standard term in the industry. Overall, the response is strong but could be improved with more detailed examples and a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies and frameworks."", 'score': 4}}","The candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of data security concepts, accurately using technical terms like AES, HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and end-to-end encryption.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: It's great to hear that you've applied your HTML and CSS skills to create a website, even if it started with a template. Understanding how to customize and style content is key. Since you've also mentioned proficiency in Python, can you walk me through how you would approach testing a Python application, particularly one that you've developed or worked on in the past? What tools or methodologies would you use to ensure the application is robust?  

Interviewee: Yeah. So currently, whatever the domain I'm currently working on, so there, currently, as I mentioned, we are doing a issue analysis. So that is of a manual work. So that we have automated by using the Python script. So what that script actually does is whatever the issue log file uploaded from the customer side, it will take that log file as a input by using the Python pandas. It will read that file input. Then from that input, whatever the parameters we are checking manually, that has been automated in the script. Like, uh, like, we are given one flowchart. For example, if this is the throughput issue, then first, you go and check the signal condition where the signal is low or high. And we have made some threshold in the Python code file. So that it will check that signal condition with our threshold, whatever we set in the Python script. Then it will create a tabler form between for example, if we have any passing devices and failing devices, it will take the reference of both the devices, and it will give in the tabular format. So that is how we have automated the manual issue analyzes to the automated script automated, uh, checking by using the Python. So in order to achieve the efficiency because, for example, if manually, if you're taking more time, for, uh, example, you can take a 6 hours if you are taking, Then automation, it it will run for only one number. So the main tools I have used in the Python is, like, pandas, Python, pandas. So that will be used as part of reading the Excel file then generating a table, then whatever checking the parameter, then, uh, the Python matplotlib or else the bouquet. Uh, in the bouquet, I've used in the Python to in order to plot the output. For example, after taking all the signal out signal inputs from the log file, then finally, it'll plot it. So by the plot, by using matplotlib or bouquet, we will able to visualize that whether the signal condition, whether it is, like, sinusoidal or it is straight without any distortion. So based on that, we will able to get a automated test result for the log, whatever the customer is uploading in order to reduce the manual effect.

So based on that, we will able to get a automated test result for the log, whatever the customer is uploading in order to reduce the manual effect.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2307, 2000, 2963, 2008, 2017, 1005, 2310, 4162, 2115, 16129, 1998, 20116, 2015, 4813, 2000, 3443, 1037, 4037, 1010, 2130, 2065, 2009, 2318, 2007, 1037, 23561, 1012, 4824, 2129, 2000, 7661, 4697, 1998, 2806, 4180, 2003, 3145, 1012, 2144, 2017, 1005, 2310, 2036, 3855, 26293, 1999, 18750, 1010, 2064, 2017, 3328, 2033, 2083, 2129, 2017, 2052, 3921, 5604, 1037, 18750, 4646, 1010, 3391, 2028, 2008, 2017, 1005, 2310, 2764, 2030, 2499, 2006, 1999, 1996, 2627, 1029, 2054, 5906, 2030, 4118, 20792, 2052, 2017, 2224, 2000, 5676, 1996, 4646, 2003, 15873, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 3398, 1012, 2061, 2747, 1010, 3649, 1996, 5884, 1045, 1005, 1049, 2747, 2551, 2006, 1010, 2061, 2045, 1010, 2747, 1010, 2004, 1045, 3855, 1010, 2057, 2024, 2725, 1037, 3277, 4106, 1012, 2061, 2008, 2003, 1997, 1037, 6410, 2147, 1012, 2061, 2008, 2057, 2031, 12978, 2011, 2478, 1996, 18750, 5896, 1012, 2061, 2054, 2008, 5896, 2941, 2515, 2003, 3649, 1996, 3277, 8833, 5371, 21345, 2013, 1996, 8013, 2217, 1010, 2009, 2097, 2202, 2008, 8833, 5371, 2004, 1037, 7953, 2011, 2478, 1996, 18750, 25462, 2015, 1012, 2009, 2097, 3191, 2008, 5371, 7953, 1012, 2059, 2013, 2008, 7953, 1010, 3649, 1996, 11709, 2057, 2024, 9361, 21118, 1010, 2008, 2038, 2042, 12978, 1999, 1996, 5896, 1012, 2066, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2057, 2024, 2445, 2028, 4834, 7507, 5339, 1012, 2005, 2742, 1010, 2065, 2023, 2003, 1996, 2083, 18780, 3277, 1010, 2059, 2034, 1010, 2017, 2175, 1998, 4638, 1996, 4742, 4650, 2073, 1996, 4742, 2003, 2659, 2030, 2152, 1012, 1998, 2057, 2031, 2081, 2070, 11207, 1999, 1996, 18750, 3642, 5371, 1012, 2061, 2008, 2009, 2097, 4638, 2008, 4742, 4650, 2007, 2256, 11207, 1010, 3649, 2057, 2275, 1999, 1996, 18750, 5896, 1012, 2059, 2009, 2097, 3443, 1037, 2795, 2099, 2433, 2090, 2005, 2742, 1010, 2065, 2057, 2031, 2151, 4458, 5733, 1998, 7989, 5733, 1010, 2009, 2097, 2202, 1996, 4431, 1997, 2119, 1996, 5733, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2097, 2507, 1999, 1996, 21628, 7934, 4289, 1012, 2061, 2008, 2003, 2129, 2057, 2031, 12978, 1996, 6410, 3277, 17908, 2015, 2000, 1996, 12978, 5896, 12978, 1010, 7910, 1010, 9361, 2011, 2478, 1996, 18750, 1012, 2061, 1999, 2344, 2000, 6162, 1996, 8122, 2138, 1010, 2005, 2742, 1010, 2065, 21118, 1010, 2065, 2017, 1005, 2128, 2635, 2062, 2051, 1010, 2005, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2742, 1010, 2017, 2064, 2202, 1037, 1020, 2847, 2065, 2017, 2024, 2635, 1010, 2059, 19309, 1010, 2009, 2009, 2097, 2448, 2005, 2069, 2028, 2193, 1012, 2061, 1996, 2364, 5906, 1045, 2031, 2109, 1999, 1996, 18750, 2003, 1010, 2066, 1010, 25462, 2015, 1010, 18750, 1010, 25462, 2015, 1012, 2061, 2008, 2097, 2022, 2109, 2004, 2112, 1997, 3752, 1996, 24970, 5371, 2059, 11717, 1037, 2795, 1010, 2059, 3649, 9361, 1996, 16381, 1010, 2059, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1996, 18750, 13523, 24759, 4140, 29521, 2030, 2842, 1996, 26700, 1012, 7910, 1010, 1999, 1996, 26700, 1010, 1045, 1005, 2310, 2109, 1999, 1996, 18750, 2000, 1999, 2344, 2000, 5436, 1996, 6434, 1012, 2005, 2742, 1010, 2044, 2635, 2035, 1996, 4742, 2041, 4742, 20407, 2013, 1996, 8833, 5371, 1010, 2059, 2633, 1010, 2009, 1005, 2222, 102]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Utilizing Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) in DynamoDB to facilitate efficient querying is indeed a key strategy for optimizing performance. Could you delve into the concept of database normalization and how it applies to both relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases, particularly in the context of your application design and data modeling?  


Interviewee: Okay. So normalization, like, refers to breaking down a particular big table into multiple different tables. For example, uh, there is a one major, uh, main table which consists of, uh, like, um, a user column and then what uh, order he has placed from a website and what is that what order value and all these things. Like right? So what normalize is normalization tells us is we need to break down, uh, further break down the, uh, the columns and and to make a separate table for all the processes which, uh, which needs to be done. For for example, in this this case, we can create a separate table for a user, uh, for user, uh, related data to store, which will store a user ID, username, and his other details, there can there can be another table, uh, which can store the order details. For example, order ID, which user has placed that particular order, what is the amount of that order, and what products are, uh, there in that particular order. And from these two tables, uh, we can, uh, write a foreign key relation on the user ID column in the order table to the user table, uh, uh, to the user table and for multiple products with if we have added. So in that case, we can have, uh, like, one to many relation on the product stable that that product is available in the product stable or not. So this way this this is how, like, normalize normalization generally works.

So this way this this is how, like, normalize normalization generally works.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 16911, 3795, 3905, 5950, 2229, 1006, 28177, 2072, 1007, 1999, 17205, 18939, 2000, 10956, 8114, 23032, 2075, 2003, 5262, 1037, 3145, 5656, 2005, 23569, 27605, 6774, 2836, 1012, 2071, 2017, 3972, 3726, 2046, 1996, 4145, 1997, 7809, 3671, 3989, 1998, 2129, 2009, 12033, 2000, 2119, 28771, 1006, 29296, 1007, 1998, 2512, 1011, 28771, 1006, 16839, 4160, 2140, 1007, 17881, 1010, 3391, 1999, 1996, 6123, 1997, 2115, 4646, 2640, 1998, 2951, 11643, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 3100, 1012, 2061, 3671, 3989, 1010, 2066, 1010, 5218, 2000, 4911, 2091, 1037, 3327, 2502, 2795, 2046, 3674, 2367, 7251, 1012, 2005, 2742, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2045, 2003, 1037, 2028, 2350, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2364, 2795, 2029, 3774, 1997, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2066, 1010, 8529, 1010, 1037, 5310, 5930, 1998, 2059, 2054, 7910, 1010, 2344, 2002, 2038, 2872, 2013, 1037, 4037, 1998, 2054, 2003, 2008, 2054, 2344, 3643, 1998, 2035, 2122, 2477, 1012, 2066, 2157, 1029, 2061, 2054, 3671, 4697, 2003, 3671, 3989, 4136, 2149, 2003, 2057, 2342, 2000, 3338, 2091, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2582, 3338, 2091, 1996, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1996, 7753, 1998, 1998, 2000, 2191, 1037, 3584, 2795, 2005, 2035, 1996, 6194, 2029, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2029, 3791, 2000, 2022, 2589, 1012, 2005, 2005, 2742, 1010, 1999, 2023, 2023, 2553, 1010, 2057, 2064, 3443, 1037, 3584, 2795, 2005, 1037, 5310, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2005, 5310, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3141, 2951, 2000, 3573, 1010, 2029, 2097, 3573, 1037, 5310, 8909, 1010, 5310, 18442, 1010, 1998, 2010, 2060, 4751, 1010, 2045, 2064, 2045, 2064, 2022, 2178, 2795, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2029, 2064, 3573, 1996, 2344, 4751, 1012, 2005, 2742, 1010, 2344, 8909, 1010, 2029, 5310, 2038, 2872, 2008, 3327, 2344, 1010, 2054, 2003, 1996, 3815, 1997, 2008, 2344, 1010, 1998, 2054, 3688, 2024, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2045, 1999, 2008, 3327, 2344, 1012, 1998, 2013, 2122, 2048, 7251, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2057, 2064, 1010, 7910, 1010, 4339, 1037, 3097, 3145, 7189, 2006, 1996, 5310, 8909, 5930, 1999, 1996, 2344, 2795, 2000, 1996, 5310, 2795, 1010, 7910, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2000, 1996, 5310, 2795, 1998, 2005, 3674, 3688, 2007, 2065, 2057, 2031, 2794, 1012, 2061, 1999, 2008, 2553, 1010, 2057, 2064, 2031, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2028, 2000, 2116, 7189, 2006, 1996, 4031, 6540, 2008, 2008, 4031, 2003, 2800, 1999, 1996, 4031, 6540, 2030, 2025, 1012, 2061, 2023, 2126, 2023, 2023, 2003, 2129, 1010, 2066, 1010, 3671, 4697, 3671, 3989, 3227, 2573, 1012, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
