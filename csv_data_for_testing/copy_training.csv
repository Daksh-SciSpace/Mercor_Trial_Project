### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Certainly, I was asking about the concept of 'one-hot encoding' and how it is applied in machine learning. Could you walk me through the process of one-hot encoding and explain why it is necessary in certain machine learning tasks? 

Interviewee: Okay. So the one hot encoding, it refers to the strategy used in machine learning and data preprocessing where the categorical variables are encoded into binary vectors with each category represented by a unique binary value 0 to 1. So in it, how it work is that, first of all, we use categorical variables that represent categorical such as colors like red, blue, green. And in one hot encoding, each category is a categorical variable that is assigned a unique binary value. For example, lights let's say I had taken an example of colors where red, blue, and green. So we can assign red as 100, blue as 010, and grade may be represented as like 1. So it is commonly used in ML algorithms, especially with categorical variables that do not have inherent ordinal relationship. It allows algorithm to effectively process categorical data as numerical input as most machine learning require numerical input data. So the benefit of one hot encoding is that from assuming any ordinal relationship between categories that might not exist, it requires that each category is treated as a distinct and independent entity during model training.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've worked with Stable Diffusion at TRI3D. Can you explain how you integrated CLIP and Segment Anything Model into the pipeline, and what impact these integrations had on the photo-realism enhancement?  

Interviewee: Yeah. Definitely. So, uh, basically, CLIP, uh, is a model which we use for captioning images. We can generate, uh, text captions for any input given image. And I'll talk specifically for CLIP firstly. So working with stable diffusion, we need a big dataset. And along with those images, we require text as well, a caption, basically. For that, uh, we need, uh, we use clip actually to generate those, uh, captions and then use them later on. Along with that, uh, the second model that you're talking about, which is, uh, segment editing model, I used that in the, uh, in the big in the pipeline itself, which is a bigger circle, uh, inside of which we have this stops this stable diffusion inference as a small module. But, yeah, apart from that, the we can use segment editing model to segment out certain parts of the, uh, images. So we were working with the, uh, human images only. And we were aiming to, uh, increase the photo realism of the person or the model wearing some certain cloth, uh, to be increasing the output. For that, we use SAM to, uh, take out certain garments. Let's say, uh, upper garment or a lower garment, the focus part that we are aiming at. And then using that, uh, that mask itself, which is generated from Sam, we can use it in further, uh, different techniques such as in painting or controlling. And then, uh, that majorly contributes to a significantly improved photorealism of the focused garment. That was all about the question.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: I'm sorry to interrupt, but could you please elaborate on the term ""regulator and homologation""? What specific tasks or responsibilities does this involve in the context of Volvo Trucks, and how did you approach these tasks to influence the certification process?  


Interviewee: OEM introduces a vehicle in India. By law, they are supposed to comply by certain safety standards. So regulation is a field which, uh, basically involves with OEMs giving input to the government and liaising with various test agencies and government agencies in order to formulate, uh, certain standards that are to come in place in the near future. That will be an essential to actually drive the technology and also ensure safety in Indian roads. Whereas homologation is, uh, an extended part of regulation, which involves testing the vehicles to comply for these actual standards, which are already which have already been formulated. So, um, like, this was what, uh, I was responsible for broadly. And in order to reduce the certification time, what I had done was, uh, uh, I had studied all the past certificate certificates that we had and used them, uh, wherever possible, whichever components haven't changed or have been slightly modified, use those base certificates to, um, uh, get the compliance for certain standards. And and only did the testing for certain changes that might have been brought into place as amendment, uh, or an update in, uh, the right now. So, uh, so that reduced the number of tests that need to be done, saved a lot of cost, and also, uh, like, developing contacts with the test agency helped in, uh, scheduling the test, uh, together so that I didn't have to worry about worry a lot or or lose a lot of time in logistics and getting the components or the vehicle to the agencies. It's clear that you had a significant impact on the certification process.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Great! Let's dive into the case study. Imagine you are working on a new feature for the Care-Lite Product at Sprinklr. The feature involves implementing a real-time notification system that alerts users about important updates or actions they need to take. This system needs to handle a high volume of notifications efficiently and ensure that users receive timely alerts without any significant delays. Given your background and expertise, how would you propose a high-level solution architecture for this real-time notification system? 


Interviewee: Okay. So to ensure that, like, I have worked on a similar problem during my time at Swinburne. So to ensure this, what we can do is that we want to send notifications, and we should it should be resilient, scalable. Do we have to send timely alerts to the users notifying about that this has happened, like so that that use case do come in our SaaS product. So, like, say, the supervisor working on something, he has to send some alert that this needs to be done to one of some other users so he can generate a notification that will be gone. So to do that, we can use an architecture, which will be some a notification service which will be working based on Kafka. So what we can do is that we will create notification task, and we will push them to Kafka. To Kafka, and we will create a producer which will be, which will be as like, the notification task will be produced by us, dub into the Kafka. And there will be listener, a standalone component, which will be consuming that task from Kafka. And what they will be doing is that they will be sending over that to all the users. So let's say the notification has to be sent. It will fetch from database that how many users are currently in this client, which we are currently in, let's say the notification is sent for one of the client, it will get all the list of all the users. And then to all the user that notification will be sent individually. So what we can do is that we can use you, take the help of MQTT servers. So what we can do is that create connections with all the users and send that that event will be published via that MQTT connection to all the users. They will receive a notification, and that notification will be saved. And then we can they can save that, notification event received in the Mongo and then we can fetch the the those notifications which are received and to all the user that notification will be shown. So this will ensure that it is timely alerts and this will all be asynchronously done so that the load will also be distributed and it it could be scalable as well.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Your use of in-memory caching with hash maps to optimize Lambda function processing is a smart approach. Given the reliance on local memory cache within the Lambda function, how did you manage the cache's size and eviction policies to ensure that the function remained efficient and didn't run into memory issues, especially when processing large batches of files? Did you implement any specific strategies to handle this? 


Interviewee: Yeah. So for, for every cache I made sure I mean, we did not want to use a cache more than n number of times. That would differ from organization to organization where their policies, which should not let us use cash, every time the same row would appear. So we had to be mindful about that. The so what I did was every time you read read from cache, I had to keep track of the read count for for every in memory read that happens. And after the threshold has been breached, I would have to just clear it out for that particular key that has been cached. And after that and that was only limited to 1 file. Once a single file was processed, the function would just kill itself. So it didn't really matter if I evict in the long run because the cash would never reach, that huge amount and the cash was, LRU cash. So, and it had the option to, tweak on how many hot, keys that you want to keep. So we just figured, we would keep n as 100 So, basically, you can cache, top 100, results at a time. So whatever was least and most frequently used, would be kept in cash. Rest would just be recomputed.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a very detailed and insightful response, thank you for sharing that experience. It's clear that you have a strong understanding of both the software and hardware aspects of validation. Given your experience with UWB features, can you discuss how you've utilized Python in your role to automate validation tests, and perhaps share an example of a script or tool you've developed?  

Interviewee: Python I didn't use Python to develop the test cases from the scratch. So the whole framework was already built. So I don't have extensive knowledge on python. I have extensive knowledge on C programming, but I can manage python. giving me an opportunity if the framework and all is already built, but Adding to the automation kind of things. Yeah, so we have around like 10,000 test cases which we need to run every day. And the runtime of this 10,000 test cases will be around like 50 hours, but we need to finish this one in less than 8 hours. Then we need to analyze that we generate the report and all so what we did is I segregated the test cases into multiple systems. So I wrote a python script which we will call particular block of test cases in one system and another set of test cases in a different system. So that's where we were able to reduce the execution time and also allow us to analyze the test results more efficiently. So that is one of the automation The scripts which I developed for in NXT.

Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Leveraging horizontal scaling based on resource consumption is a smart way to handle scalability. Considering the high volume of webhooks you mentioned processing at Cashfree Payments, how did you design the system to handle this load, and what kind of NoSQL or SQL database did you use to store and manage these webhook details efficiently?  

Interviewee: Okay. So first, any any webhook of the cache, but we have a notification service. Right? So whenever any request comes to this notification service, we in the request, we mention, um, the API endpoint to which we want to send the webhook and the request data. And this calls, uh, is this call is set synchronously to the external, um, external party to which we want to send the webhook. Okay? And after this, we will get synced. Uh, we want if we want to since we want to store this data in a database also, then, uh, doing this in a synchronous way is not the best practice because, uh, your database delays, like, latency can slow down your entire system. So how we implemented that was after the Google gets sent and we get a response, we will push that into a separate Kafka topic. And then there is a consumer, uh, working at the other end, which will consume those messages from that Kafka topic and, uh, store that into a database. We had used a NoSQL MongoDB in this case, considering the number of high high number of webhooks that we have to send every day since, um, uh, no not in list and databases are, uh, more horizontally scalable. There is for the reason why we had used, uh, my, uh, MongoDB in this case. Um, also, if we, uh, uh, also, if we talk about the, um, scalability aspect of the webhooks, then if we get a huge number of webhooks, then, um, um, then if, uh, if we start getting a higher number of webhooks, then we can just increase the partitions in our corporate topic and just increase the number of consumers who are consuming the messages from that topic. Right? Since we will simultaneously consume more number of more number of messages from that topic, this will handle the scalability issues.

Um, also, if we, uh, uh, also, if we talk about the, um, scalability aspect of the webhooks, then if we get a huge number of webhooks, then, um, um, then if, uh, if we start getting a higher number of webhooks, then we can just increase the partitions in our corporate topic and just increase the number of consumers who are consuming the messages from that topic. Right? Since we will simultaneously consume more number of more number of messages from that topic, this will handle the scalability issues.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 15929, 16594, 9876, 25169, 2241, 2006, 7692, 8381, 2003, 1037, 6047, 2126, 2000, 5047, 26743, 8553, 1012, 6195, 1996, 2152, 3872, 1997, 4773, 6806, 6559, 2015, 2017, 3855, 6364, 2012, 5356, 23301, 10504, 1010, 2129, 2106, 2017, 2640, 1996, 2291, 2000, 5047, 2023, 7170, 1010, 1998, 2054, 2785, 1997, 16839, 4160, 2140, 2030, 29296, 7809, 2106, 2017, 2224, 2000, 3573, 1998, 6133, 2122, 4773, 6806, 6559, 4751, 18228, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 3100, 1012, 2061, 2034, 1010, 2151, 2151, 4773, 6806, 6559, 1997, 1996, 17053, 1010, 2021, 2057, 2031, 1037, 26828, 2326, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2061, 7188, 2151, 5227, 3310, 2000, 2023, 26828, 2326, 1010, 2057, 1999, 1996, 5227, 1010, 2057, 5254, 1010, 8529, 1010, 1996, 17928, 2203, 8400, 2000, 2029, 2057, 2215, 2000, 4604, 1996, 4773, 6806, 6559, 1998, 1996, 5227, 2951, 1012, 1998, 2023, 4455, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2003, 2023, 2655, 2003, 2275, 26351, 8093, 17175, 27191, 2000, 1996, 6327, 1010, 8529, 1010, 6327, 2283, 2000, 2029, 2057, 2215, 2000, 4604, 1996, 4773, 6806, 6559, 1012, 3100, 1029, 1998, 2044, 2023, 1010, 2057, 2097, 2131, 26351, 2098, 1012, 7910, 1010, 2057, 2215, 2065, 2057, 2215, 2000, 2144, 2057, 2215, 2000, 3573, 2023, 2951, 1999, 1037, 7809, 2036, 1010, 2059, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2725, 2023, 1999, 1037, 26351, 8093, 17175, 2271, 2126, 2003, 2025, 1996, 2190, 3218, 2138, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2115, 7809, 14350, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2397, 9407, 2064, 4030, 2091, 2115, 2972, 2291, 1012, 2061, 2129, 2057, 7528, 2008, 2001, 2044, 1996, 8224, 4152, 2741, 1998, 2057, 2131, 1037, 3433, 1010, 2057, 2097, 5245, 2008, 2046, 1037, 3584, 10556, 24316, 2050, 8476, 1012, 1998, 2059, 2045, 2003, 1037, 7325, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2551, 2012, 1996, 2060, 2203, 1010, 2029, 2097, 16678, 2216, 7696, 2013, 2008, 10556, 24316, 2050, 8476, 1998, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3573, 2008, 2046, 1037, 7809, 1012, 2057, 2018, 2109, 1037, 16839, 4160, 2140, 12256, 3995, 18939, 1999, 2023, 2553, 1010, 6195, 1996, 2193, 1997, 2152, 2152, 2193, 1997, 4773, 6806, 6559, 2015, 2008, 2057, 2031, 2000, 4604, 2296, 2154, 2144, 1010, 8529, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2053, 2025, 1999, 2862, 1998, 17881, 2024, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2062, 23190, 26743, 3468, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2005, 1996, 3114, 2339, 2057, 2018, 2109, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2026, 1010, 7910, 1010, 12256, 3995, 18939, 1999, 2023, 2553, 1012, 8529, 1010, 2036, 1010, 2065, 2057, 1010, 7910, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2036, 1010, 2065, 2057, 2831, 2055, 1996, 1010, 8529, 1010, 26743, 8553, 7814, 1997, 1996, 4773, 6806, 6559, 2015, 1010, 2059, 2065, 2057, 2131, 1037, 4121, 2193, 1997, 4773, 6806, 6559, 2015, 1010, 2059, 1010, 8529, 1010, 8529, 1010, 2059, 2065, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2065, 2057, 2707, 2893, 1037, 3020, 2193, 1997, 4773, 6806, 6559, 2015, 1010, 2059, 2057, 2064, 2074, 3623, 1996, 13571, 2015, 1999, 2256, 5971, 8476, 1998, 2074, 3623, 1996, 2193, 1997, 10390, 2040, 2024, 15077, 1996, 7696, 2013, 2008, 8476, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2144, 2057, 2097, 7453, 16678, 2062, 2193, 1997, 2062, 2193, 1997, 7696, 2013, 2008, 8476, 1010, 2023, 2097, 5047, 1996, 26743, 8553, 3314, 1012, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a solid approach to front-end development, ensuring a smooth user experience with React and Redux for state management. Your use of custom hooks and generic components to handle API calls is a good practice for maintainability. Given your experience with React and state management, how do you handle state synchronization between different components, especially when dealing with complex state that needs to be shared across the application?  

Interviewee: For that. Okay, so it basically depends on what how frequently the states are changing. So for example for the high frequency, if the states are changing on a very highly frequent basis and the states needs to be, you know, shared across the whole application then we relied on Redux, but for a very basic States, for example, if the user is logged in or not, just giving you an example we were using context because that is something which is not frequently changing. So for that we have used context but for all managing all the complex States and for managing highly frequently changing states, we have used Redux. So we have created a store and then we have utilized the connector keyword that is used to connect any component to that Redux store and then we give some dispatchers inside it and the structure dispatches the function and it calls the reducer that actually makes changes to that particular State. Also, we have utilized a simple State, you know. For just by using simple use State methods and also passing it down to the component. So, oh this particular use case is only for those states which requires that does not require any any states. We present all over the solution. So it just needs a simple communication between two small components. So yeah for that we've just used simple used it. So yeah, we are trying to utilize reduction text and you States everything wherever it is possible because of the every every you state reductions and context have their own. Like shortcomings as well because you can't use you state to provide, you know data to the whole solution or context is not good for high frequency State change the state basically which changes very frequently that is not good to use context in that place. But relaxed can be used in that case. So yeah we have Done all this using all of these three.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a smart approach, staggering the release process and setting KPIs to measure success. Given your experience with Kubernetes, how would you handle a situation where a Kubernetes deployment is not scaling as expected? What steps would you take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue? 

Interviewee: That's a smart approach, staggering the release process and setting k p's to measure success. Given your experience with Kubernetes, how would you handle a situation where Kubernetes deployment is not scaling as expected? What steps would you take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue? 1st, I would try to identify what the scaling parameters are so we can check that with, um, checking if horizontal port auto scaling has been enabled or not. Simultaneously, I would also check if metrics server is installed or not because metrics server is responsible to, uh, measure the metrics on which the scaling may happen. If horizontal port auto scaling is enabled, I would then check what the scaling parameters have been set. And simultaneously, I would also check, uh, what other parameters are necessary to ensure that the ensure that the scaling happens properly. So if there are any custom metrics that are required in terms of horizontal port auto scaling, then those metrics can be fed as a custom parameters using, uh, the tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. And we can then leverage insights from these specific tools to perform horizontal auto scaling and to check if HPA events as and while we do that, we can also check out the HPA events or horizontal or auto scaler events to see what's exactly blocking is it due to the node node limitations has been reached as the the underlying node not scaling out as well. So for example, if the pods, uh, are not

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've completed a software development internship at Amazon India. Can you tell me more about the web application you worked on and how you specifically contributed to managing databases for internal organizations? 

Interviewee: Yeah, sure. So my tenure at Amazon started from January to June this year and it was software development engineering internship over the span where I worked there was initially tasked with actually learning and wrapping up with different Technologies, which included node.js react JS and databases which include MySQL and dynamodb. So once I was done with this, I was actually tasked with what are application was which was handling the data and storing them in internal Amazon application databases. So here what I had to do was create an onboarding feature. So this feature essentially was to be a front-end back-end and full stack feature and what it essentially does first. So the old process being done manually. So all of this was now being avoided I would present user interface where a customer here the customer being an internal Amazon use it would come in put in their details and directly get onboarded onto our internal to so what this did was reduced the overall operational time from what was a manual process which took two days to now two minutes. So in this way, I was able to contribute to my team by creating an onboarding feature which overall cut down the operational type apart from this also work with the few other features, including reworking and Aida tool which brought down And found a new issues and ensure that customer's data is sustainable and also prevents any loss in data. This was another feature which I worked on apart from that I also worked on migrating and existing Lambda deprecating it and moving all of it to the generic Lambda therefore, thereby increasing efficiency and onboarding time or development time which was cut down by 10 days. So overall these were some of the features which I worked on and I learned a lot from it as well as contributed towards keeping an internal customers data safe secure and complaint.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: It's clear you have a good understanding of both Flask and FastAPI, and you've made practical decisions based on the project requirements and your experience. Now, considering your work with cloud providers, can you tell me about a time when you had to optimize a data engineering pipeline on GCP, perhaps using BigQuery or another tool, and what strategies you employed to improve its performance or cost efficiency?  

Interviewee: Yeah. Alright. I can, uh, tell about it. Uh, like, in my previous company where I, uh, worked as a GCP data engineering intern, So we built quite a few, uh, data engineering pipeline for gathering data and dumping into the data lake or what we used as, like, for BigQuery. So we were collecting various, uh, what you guys are monitoring kind of data from different sources like PCs and, uh, mobile phones and different applications. The project was like employee data monitoring. So we were collecting various data from various sources, and we were, uh, using this transformation pipeline that we built on Google Cloud Functions earlier. And we were not dumping the entire series of data into the BigQuery. But, uh, no. First, we were collecting it, uh, from the sources into a SQL Server on, uh, on cloud, like Cloud SQL. And then we were using Cloud Functions to trigger, uh, various workloads or workflows to dump the data and transform it, uh, extract the data and transform it and dump it into the BigQuery for various analysis purposes. But the problem was that using cloud functions, uh, there was a lot of overhead that we were facing and the lim and a lot of limitations as well. So later on, we switched to, uh, Apache Airflow or Cloud Composer in GCP, which, uh, basically can, uh, you can easily, uh, build out total pipeline or workflow using the bags that we, uh, are there in the Airflow. So, uh, that was a lot, uh, help in the field in, like, in the different workflows for all the pipelines, basically, extraction or transformation pipelines that we were working on. Earlier, like, in normal Python, uh, or in cloud functions, the codes were, like, too long, and, uh, we will have to manually create the tags ourselves. But while we shifted towards Apache Airflow, like, the deck creation was so easy and even the triggers and, uh, like, the scheduling activity of the Airflow as well. So those all features, like, came as an advantage over Google Cloud functions for making our transformation pipeline that we, uh, worked on. So, yeah, that's how we optimize our entire pipeline, uh, shifting from cloud functions like native Python Cloud function to, uh, Google Cloud Composer or, uh, using Apache Airflow like that. Yep. So that is how we mainly optimize the entire workload. And, also, other than that, uh, we, uh, I myself worked in a little bit of, uh, code optimization in the in both Aperce airflow as well as, uh, Google Cloud functions in Python both. So, yeah, we uh, reduced a lot of overheads and redundant, uh, transformation and calculations as well. Like, for example, when we are all we were already dumping a little bit of raw data in cloud, uh, in SQL server or, like, the Cloud SQL. So but there were a lot of raw raw data that were being stored initially. So using, like, normal basic, uh, transformation while extracting the data using, uh, the queries that we were running or the big or the, basically, the SQL jobs. So on the source itself, I performed a little bit of optimization so that we don't have to go, uh, over and over again with the cleaning and the transformation process earlier, but that can be done, like, easily while performing a query or something like that. So, yeah, that's how I, as a, like, part of the team, uh, optimize the entire pipeline in my previous, uh, in my company.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a very comprehensive approach, and it sounds like you've made significant contributions to the project. Given your experience with data science, I'm curious about the Hyper-parameter Tuning Framework you assembled at Delab Research. Could you elaborate on how you utilized Optuna for this framework and what specific challenges you faced during its implementation?  

Interviewee: Yep. So as you said, I was using Optuna, uh, library, uh, for the hyperparameter tuning. So the project that, uh, the team was working on, uh, they that involved, uh, different kinds of architectures, different models, basically, to to solve the problem, which was in a non intrusive load management. And yeah. For all of those different architectures, we had to fire, uh, hyper, like, fine tune the hyperparameters. And I had to come up with a generic, uh, approach where we can actually monitor all the different architectures with all the different possibilities of the, uh, hyperparameters that we're choosing to fine tune. So with that in mind and, uh, there were so initially, there were a couple of options, Raytheon and then Optuna. But, uh, when I went deep inside both of them to actually evaluate which of them would be better, Optuna seemed to be a better choice because, uh, so we were working on MLflow, which is, uh, another platform we had like, we were using at DLAP Research where we, uh, were managing the model cycles, the life cycles of machine learning models. We were storing all of the models there, and it was from there only that a production model was being taken from. And, uh, on the web as well, so there was a lot of community work that was already present. Integrating MLflow with Oktuna, recording all of the things, and then, uh, productionizing only the, uh, only the model that that performs best with the best parameters. That was the choice. That was the reasoning behind, uh, choosing Optune, and it helped a lot, actually. It was the right choice. And, also, there was a lot of, uh, documentation and community work on the coding part as well. There were a lot of functions. It was new at that time only. But, yeah, it served well. As for the second part of your question is concerned, uh, some challenges that I faced with Optune itself. So, yeah, as a beginner at that time, uh, there were some technical challenges. One of them was, uh, that we had to so every, uh, experiment that Optuna runs, which is basically, uh, an experiment with one set of hyperparameters. Sorry. We log all those, uh, the results of those, uh, those experiments into ML, uh, into ML flow or Optima as an experiment. Right? And since we were dealing with MLflow, what happened to be the issue was once we're done with an experiment in MLflow, we would have to take that experiment back into the run time. We would have to restart that experiment. And then over on top of that, we wanted to, uh, run the hyperparameters so that both MLflow and Optuna were on the same, uh, on the same front. Basically, they had to be synchronized for every experiment that we run on MLflow and on Optimum. That, uh, was, I think, a bit tricky for me. At that time, I, uh, had just started with the data science journey of mine. Uh, but, yeah, I was able to tackle that problem. The I had to look into the source code of Optima that, uh, that helped a lot and also the documentation of which was a little tricky to be dealt with. Because as far as that synchronization was concerned, I couldn't really find much sources on the Internet. But, yeah, that source code really helped and also my mentor. So he was constantly supporting me, uh, on what things can be, uh, done and was there even a possibility to actually change the source code for ourselves and manipulate things? Uh, because it was open source. So that was also one possibility that we considered. But then, eventually, we, uh, figured out a way to, uh, do things, like, on a higher level without really messing up the source code. And, yeah, things actually worked, and, uh, we were able to solve that problem.

Given your experience with data science, I'm curious about the Hyper-parameter Tuning Framework you assembled at Delab Research. Could you elaborate on how you utilized Optuna for this framework and what specific challenges you faced during its implementation?  

Interviewee: Yep. So as you said, I was using Optuna, uh, library, uh, for the hyperparameter tuning. So the project that, uh, the team was working on, uh, they that involved, uh, different kinds of architectures, different models, basically, to to solve the problem, which was in a non intrusive load management. And yeah. For all of those different architectures, we had to fire, uh, hyper, like, fine tune the hyperparameters. And I had to come up with a generic, uh, approach where we can actually monitor all the different architectures with all the different possibilities of the, uh, hyperparameters that we're choosing to fine tune. So with that in mind and, uh, there were so initially, there were a couple of options, Raytheon and then Optuna. But, uh, when I went deep inside both of them to actually evaluate which of them would be better, Optuna seemed to be a better choice because, uh, so we were working on MLflow, which is, uh, another platform we had like, we were using at DLAP Research where we, uh, were managing the model cycles, the life cycles of machine learning models. We were storing all of the models there, and it was from there only that a production model was being taken from. And, uh, on the web as well, so there was a lot of community work that was already present. Integrating MLflow with Oktuna, recording all of the things, and then, uh, productionizing only the, uh, only the model that that performs best with the best parameters. That was the choice. That was the reasoning behind, uh, choosing Optune, and it helped a lot, actually. It was the right choice. And, also, there was a lot of, uh, documentation and community work on the coding part as well. There were a lot of functions. It was new at that time only. But, yeah, it served well. As for the second part of your question is concerned, uh, some challenges that I faced with Optune itself. So, yeah, as a beginner at that time, uh, there were some technical challenges. One of them was, uh, that we had to so every, uh, experiment that Optuna runs, which is basically, uh, an experiment with one set of hyperparameters. Sorry. We log all those, uh, the results of those, uh, those experiments into ML, uh, into ML flow or Optima as an experiment. Right? And since we were dealing with MLflow, what happened to be the issue was once we're done with an experiment in MLflow, we would have to take that experiment back into the run time. We would have to restart that experiment. And then over on top of that, we wanted to, uh, run the hyperparameters so that both MLflow and Optuna were on the same, uh, on the same front. Basically, they had to be synchronized for every experiment that we run on MLflow and on Optimum. That, uh, was, I think, a bit tricky for me. At that time, I, uh, had just started with the data science journey of mine. Uh, but, yeah, I was able to tackle that problem. The I had to look into the source code of Optima that, uh, that helped a lot and also the documentation of which was a little tricky to be dealt with. Because as far as that synchronization was concerned, I couldn't really find much sources on the Internet. But, yeah, that source code really helped and also my mentor. So he was constantly supporting me, uh, on what things can be, uh, done and was there even a possibility to actually change the source code for ourselves and manipulate things? Uh, because it was open source. So that was also one possibility that we considered. But then, eventually, we, uh, figured out a way to, uh, do things, like, on a higher level without really messing up the source code. And, yeah, things actually worked, and, uh, we were able to solve that problem.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 2008, 1005, 1055, 1037, 2200, 7721, 3921, 1010, 1998, 2009, 4165, 2066, 2017, 1005, 2310, 2081, 3278, 5857, 2000, 1996, 2622, 1012, 2445, 2115, 3325, 2007, 2951, 2671, 1010, 1045, 1005, 1049, 8025, 2055, 1996, 23760, 1011, 16381, 17372, 7705, 2017, 9240, 2012, 3972, 7875, 2470, 1012, 2071, 2017, 9603, 2006, 2129, 2017, 12550, 23569, 9521, 2005, 2023, 7705, 1998, 2054, 3563, 7860, 2017, 4320, 2076, 2049, 7375, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 15624, 1012, 2061, 2004, 2017, 2056, 1010, 1045, 2001, 2478, 23569, 9521, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3075, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2005, 1996, 23760, 28689, 22828, 17372, 1012, 2061, 1996, 2622, 2008, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1996, 2136, 2001, 2551, 2006, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2027, 2008, 2920, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2367, 7957, 1997, 4294, 2015, 1010, 2367, 4275, 1010, 10468, 1010, 2000, 2000, 9611, 1996, 3291, 1010, 2029, 2001, 1999, 1037, 2512, 20014, 7946, 3512, 7170, 2968, 1012, 1998, 3398, 1012, 2005, 2035, 1997, 2216, 2367, 4294, 2015, 1010, 2057, 2018, 2000, 2543, 1010, 7910, 1010, 23760, 1010, 2066, 1010, 2986, 8694, 1996, 23760, 28689, 22828, 2015, 1012, 1998, 1045, 2018, 2000, 2272, 2039, 2007, 1037, 12391, 1010, 7910, 1010, 3921, 2073, 2057, 2064, 2941, 8080, 2035, 1996, 2367, 4294, 2015, 2007, 2035, 1996, 2367, 12020, 1997, 1996, 1010, 7910, 1010, 23760, 28689, 22828, 2015, 2008, 2057, 1005, 2128, 10549, 2000, 2986, 8694, 1012, 2061, 2007, 2008, 1999, 2568, 1998, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2045, 2020, 2061, 3322, 1010, 2045, 2020, 1037, 3232, 1997, 7047, 1010, 4097, 10760, 2239, 1998, 2059, 23569, 9521, 1012, 2021, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2043, 1045, 2253, 2784, 2503, 2119, 1997, 2068, 2000, 2941, 16157, 2029, 1997, 2068, 2052, 2022, 2488, 1010, 23569, 9521, 2790, 2000, 2022, 1037, 2488, 3601, 2138, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 2057, 2020, 2551, 2006, 19875, 12314, 1010, 2029, 2003, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2178, 4132, 2057, 2018, 2066, 1010, 2057, 2020, 2478, 2012, 21469, 9331, 2470, 2073, 2057, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2020, 6605, 1996, 2944, 12709, 1010, 1996, 2166, 12709, 1997, 3698, 4083, 4275, 1012, 2057, 2020, 23977, 2035, 1997, 1996, 4275, 2045, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2001, 2013, 2045, 2069, 2008, 1037, 2537, 2944, 2001, 2108, 2579, 2013, 1012, 1998, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2006, 1996, 4773, 2004, 2092, 1010, 2061, 2045, 2001, 1037, 2843, 1997, 2451, 2147, 2008, 2001, 2525, 2556, 1012, 22380, 19875, 12314, 2007, 7929, 8525, 2532, 1010, 3405, 2035, 1997, 1996, 2477, 1010, 1998, 2059, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2537, 6026, 2069, 1996, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2069, 1996, 2944, 2008, 2008, 10438, 2190, 2007, 1996, 2190, 11709, 1012, 2008, 2001, 1996, 3601, 1012, 2008, 2001, 1996, 13384, 2369, 1010, 7910, 1010, 10549, 23569, 9816, 1010, 1998, 2009, 3271, 1037, 2843, 1010, 2941, 1012, 2009, 2001, 1996, 2157, 3601, 1012, 1998, 1010, 2036, 1010, 2045, 2001, 1037, 2843, 1997, 1010, 7910, 1010, 12653, 1998, 2451, 2147, 2006, 1996, 16861, 2112, 2004, 2092, 1012, 2045, 2020, 1037, 2843, 1997, 4972, 1012, 2009, 2001, 2047, 2012, 2008, 2051, 2069, 1012, 2021, 1010, 3398, 1010, 2009, 2366, 2092, 1012, 2004, 2005, 1996, 2117, 2112, 1997, 2115, 3160, 2003, 4986, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2070, 102]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a comprehensive overview, thank you. It's impressive to see how you've managed to integrate both Flutter and React in a single project. Given your experience with Node.js on the backend, could you describe a challenging performance issue you encountered and how you went about diagnosing and resolving it? 

Interviewee: Yep. Sure. That's, uh, what I've done, uh, in the recent experience. I'll just like to share that. So what was happening is there were few API calls in the negotiation around of the CLM model as I stated. Right? So those, uh, the emails were taking time to, you know, uh, getting delivered on the counterparty side because the emails, uh, jobs were, you know, entered in a queue, and then they were picked from that queue, and then they were, uh, delivering those emails. So sometimes, uh, there was some intermittent issue, and it took some longer time to deliver those emails as well as there was few, uh, performance side issues on the server. So based on debugging this particular issue, I went to know that, uh, there are few performance issue on my server. So for every negotiation known, uh, kind of the back end API was, you know, fetching, uh, doing, um, large operations, like, you know, fetching the legal agreement from, uh, s three bucket, uh, the entire big legal agreement, and then, uh, uh, fetching data from d v, that 2 joining various tables and getting those data from there. So there I saw there is a performance gap here, so the improvement could be done here. So the improvement of the solution, which I could become of course, uh, using, uh, caching service. So I use memcache for that, and then I cached those particular API responses. And for every negotiation round, we don't have to go to s 3 and we don't have to go to all the DB and join the tables and get to the data required for us. We just, uh, I just cached those, and then it was really fast, uh, getting those information on the way and then, uh, using those information and then sending the emails to the counter party. So those were the issues which I identified, uh, from the performance point of view, and this is how I updated and solved the issue. So those were working really great after the fix which happened. That's all. Thanks.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: The use of Jira's timeline feature, prioritization, and status tracking are indeed powerful for managing backlogs. Your approach to story writing with a focus on user scope, testing scenarios, acceptance criteria, and technical details is comprehensive. How do you ensure that these detailed stories are effectively communicated to the development team, and what role do you play in refining these stories during sprint planning or backlog grooming sessions?  

Interviewee: For the first question, how are those details, um, I mean, um, shared out? Right? Those are there are 2 there there are uh, primarily, 2 main events where these details are discussed. 1 is during the PI planning where the entire team meets and we discuss on, you know, we have spikes. Right? The spikes are one of the, uh, spikes of the spikes are one of the sprints where we discuss on the features, high level features in detail and scope of the requirement. So that's one part that's leading to these details, uh, being entered. The other one is the PI planning, uh, so where all the team comes in and they give their ideas and draft it. And then after the PR planning, I would say it's the sprint planning where if there are some new learnings that has to be, uh, why we discuss that. And if there are new learnings to be added there, that's where, uh, we, uh, uh, put we refine those if there is a refinement needed. Right? So those are the three places where the team comes in and they all they check the details and they, um, share more concerns, um, if needed. So it is a spike which gives an output to the overall epic. Then there is the PI planning where the details are discussed in detail. The developers and the team comes in, um, and we share the details. And the last is the sprint planning where, you know, if team the team decides to, um, make some changes, uh, prior to what we have discussed in the PI, that can be done as well. So that's those are the 3, uh, places. And, uh, so what what was your second question? You've

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's quite interesting. Ensemble learning, such as using Random Forest, is indeed a powerful technique for improving accuracy. Now, let's talk about your experience with IoT. You mentioned creating an IoT-based parking solution. Could you elaborate on how you integrated IoT with machine learning in this project, and what were the key challenges you faced? 

Interviewee: So yeah, so coming to the integration of iot. So what we have used were we had a couple of years we had Delta Sonic sensors hooked up with an esp32 esp32 is basically microcontroller which has Wi-Fi built in it if I'm available in it. So whenever when we also had an RFID sensor to read the fast tag data, so basically fast tag data was the unique data which were collecting to ensure that every car is unique. I identified. So what we have done was we had in our aesthetic hooked up with a Wi-Fi and later on it was connected to the network and we had it back and basically build of mongodb so we had in script running where Wherever the mongodb data fields are updated from the esp32. So basically what happened was we had a we had a code written in I think it was in arena.io and papers get into the esp32 when it is connected to the Wi-Fi. We have given at a particular database name and other credentials, so when it is connected their database and when it finds a change for example in our case when vehicle enters and it matches and RFID with the existing database It is directly updated in the database in the mongodb and that is further on reflected in the website. Website through our JavaScript which I mentioned before and we could be able to view it on the web page. So this was a simple. Simple program which which simple project which includes a hardware connected to the back end of mongodb and again comes to the front end with JavaScript browser print and sources such as react and node.

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Thank you for that detailed response. It's clear you've put a lot of thought into system design and principles. You mentioned integrating with various microservices, such as the pricing and Zulu teams. Can you elaborate on how you handled data consistency and transaction management across these distributed systems, especially considering you were working with NoSQL databases? 

Interviewee: Can you elaborate on how you handled data consistency and transaction management across these distributed systems? Especially considering you were working with NoSQL databases? Yeah. Sure. So what what happens, uh, so no sequel with as our team responsibilities to generate some banners. Right? So what happens even it's a it's we store the balance into no sequel DB. So even we have some little bit of inconsistency that hardly matters to us. For us, uh, the the thing is the main thing which we focus is on, uh, you know, focuses on the scale. So we have lots of, uh, banners, so that's why we use NoSQL DB. We compromise on the, um, basically, the consistency part. But, uh, coming to coming to interacting with other services. Right? So whenever we we use we use Kafka we use Kafka for streaming the event. So whenever our events comes, we listen to their topics. And our topic comes, we call the, uh, call PNP team. Right? So PNP team, what it does, it takes our banner ID. Uh, so basically it takes the product list, which we have sent to them. So in the request, what we do, we call their APIs in the batch. So we suppose I have 100 products. So what I do, I break I create batch of 25, 25 products. So there will be 4 batch calls. Right? So, uh, we maintain the batch calls. And when we call them, they they return the price. So with against a particular product ID, they returns the price. So consistency is always there. Right? So because we we that's a that's a blocking call. So they they give us the response, and we we store it and, you know, put the data into the banner and for further enrichment. Yeah. So for this for me making the consistency, suppose some of the banners are missed. Right? So we retry on those banners. Suppose some of the banners, some of the products we didn't get the price. So we do a retry. And suppose after some time it's failed, so we we neglect that thing and, uh, and move forward. So if suppose large number of large number of products are have failures. Right? So we do health check on these things. And if you see that we'll get most of the products are filled in fetching the price, we discard their banner.

And if you see that we'll get most of the products are filled in fetching the price, we discard their banner.","[[101, 4357, 2121, 1024, 4067, 2017, 2005, 2008, 6851, 3433, 1012, 2009, 1005, 1055, 3154, 2017, 1005, 2310, 2404, 1037, 2843, 1997, 2245, 2046, 2291, 2640, 1998, 6481, 1012, 2017, 3855, 22380, 2007, 2536, 12702, 8043, 7903, 2229, 1010, 2107, 2004, 1996, 20874, 1998, 27359, 2780, 1012, 2064, 2017, 9603, 2006, 2129, 2017, 8971, 2951, 18700, 1998, 12598, 2968, 2408, 2122, 5500, 3001, 1010, 2926, 6195, 2017, 2020, 2551, 2007, 16839, 4160, 2140, 17881, 1029, 4357, 4402, 1024, 2064, 2017, 9603, 2006, 2129, 2017, 8971, 2951, 18700, 1998, 12598, 2968, 2408, 2122, 5500, 3001, 1029, 2926, 6195, 2017, 2020, 2551, 2007, 16839, 4160, 2140, 17881, 1029, 3398, 1012, 2469, 1012, 2061, 2054, 2054, 6433, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2061, 2053, 8297, 2007, 2004, 2256, 2136, 10198, 2000, 9699, 2070, 23562, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2061, 2054, 6433, 2130, 2009, 1005, 1055, 1037, 2009, 1005, 1055, 2057, 3573, 1996, 5703, 2046, 2053, 8297, 16962, 1012, 2061, 2130, 2057, 2031, 2070, 2210, 2978, 1997, 4297, 5644, 27870, 9407, 2008, 6684, 5609, 2000, 2149, 1012, 2005, 2149, 1010, 7910, 1010, 1996, 1996, 2518, 2003, 1996, 2364, 2518, 2029, 2057, 3579, 2003, 2006, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2017, 2113, 1010, 7679, 2006, 1996, 4094, 1012, 2061, 2057, 2031, 7167, 1997, 1010, 7910, 1010, 23562, 1010, 2061, 2008, 1005, 1055, 2339, 2057, 2224, 16839, 4160, 2140, 16962, 1012, 2057, 12014, 2006, 1996, 1010, 8529, 1010, 10468, 1010, 1996, 18700, 2112, 1012, 2021, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2746, 2000, 2746, 2000, 21935, 2007, 2060, 2578, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2061, 7188, 2057, 2057, 2224, 2057, 2224, 10556, 24316, 2050, 2057, 2224, 10556, 24316, 2050, 2005, 11058, 1996, 2724, 1012, 2061, 7188, 2256, 2824, 3310, 1010, 2057, 4952, 2000, 2037, 7832, 1012, 1998, 2256, 8476, 3310, 1010, 2057, 2655, 1996, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2655, 1052, 16275, 2136, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2061, 1052, 16275, 2136, 1010, 2054, 2009, 2515, 1010, 2009, 3138, 2256, 9484, 8909, 1012, 7910, 1010, 2061, 10468, 2009, 3138, 1996, 4031, 2862, 1010, 2029, 2057, 2031, 2741, 2000, 2068, 1012, 2061, 1999, 1996, 5227, 1010, 2054, 2057, 2079, 1010, 2057, 2655, 2037, 17928, 2015, 1999, 1996, 14108, 1012, 2061, 2057, 6814, 1045, 2031, 2531, 3688, 1012, 2061, 2054, 1045, 2079, 1010, 1045, 3338, 1045, 3443, 14108, 1997, 2423, 1010, 2423, 3688, 1012, 2061, 2045, 2097, 2022, 1018, 14108, 4455, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2061, 1010, 7910, 1010, 2057, 5441, 1996, 14108, 4455, 1012, 1998, 2043, 2057, 2655, 2068, 1010, 2027, 2027, 2709, 1996, 3976, 1012, 2061, 2007, 2114, 1037, 3327, 4031, 8909, 1010, 2027, 5651, 1996, 3976, 1012, 2061, 18700, 2003, 2467, 2045, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2061, 2138, 2057, 2057, 2008, 1005, 1055, 1037, 2008, 1005, 1055, 1037, 10851, 2655, 1012, 2061, 2027, 2027, 2507, 2149, 1996, 3433, 1010, 1998, 2057, 2057, 3573, 2009, 1998, 1010, 2017, 2113, 1010, 2404, 1996, 2951, 2046, 1996, 9484, 1998, 2005, 2582, 27226, 1012, 3398, 1012, 2061, 2005, 2023, 2005, 2033, 2437, 1996, 18700, 1010, 6814, 2070, 1997, 1996, 23562, 2024, 4771, 1012, 2157, 1029, 2061, 2057, 2128, 11129, 2006, 2216, 23562, 1012, 6814, 2070, 1997, 1996, 23562, 1010, 2070, 1997, 1996, 3688, 2057, 2134, 1005, 102]]"

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: Certainly. In the context of backend development, how do you manage the trade-offs between real-time data processing, scalability, and cost when working on systems like high-volume message clustering platforms?  

Interviewee: So here, what what we can do here is that, uh, instead of directly for example, if you are receiving 1,000 messages, instead of directly hitting them, uh, hitting them through the API, like, passing them to another service, what you're gonna do is store it in the DB, okay, or store put it in a queue. And then from the queue, uh, the other service can consume based on, uh, uh, its capability. Right? Its capability resources that are available on that side. Now it might take more time. Right? And which is fine. Like, you don't need recommendations in real time. You don't need insights in the real time. It's fine if you if the if the user, uh, insights in the real time. It's fine if you if the if the user, uh, comes next time and then sees it. Right? So you should not, like, just scale, uh, 2,000 a 1000 x if the message count goes up. Right? Which is fine if sometimes it is delayed. So we need to use things like queues. Uh, another thing which we which can be done is, for example, if the messages DB, then you can do, uh, things like the database streaming. Okay? So in case of database streaming, what will happen is, let's say, if you are using DynamoDB, uh, and AWS Lambda, for example, then DynamoDB, uh, I mean, AWS would hit your Lambda, like, 4 times in a second. Right? So every 2 50 milliseconds, it will hit and will give you the data that came in that duration. So you can cluster it. You can analyze it, and then, uh, again, store it in the DB, uh, in another d database, obviously, uh, in a in a NoSQL database, for example. And then every every 2:50 millisecond, you will receive. So you know at what rate you will be receiving. Right? It will be surprising. So you won't suddenly start receiving messages every millisecond. You will just you know, uh, every second, you will receive 4 requests. Okay. So you can scale it. You can you can create resources according to that. Uh, so they have streaming, uh, queues. These support things can be used to buffer, the data and also to keep, uh, basically to load balance. Right? Indirectly, these queues are load balancing. So so if there are 5 lemnas, they can absorb they can, uh, take the messages as they as and when they are free or as and when they are done. Right? So these these these type of things we can do. Other than that, uh, if the, you know, real if you really needed, uh, real time, then instead of using CPUs, I will use GPUs. Okay. For example, if I'm clustering the messages, then I would use GPUs. I would use HDB scan, which performs really well. I would use UMAP, uh, to reduce the dimensions. So then the performance would be very good. Uh, so, overall, these type of things, I I would

### Evaluator Background

You are an expert technical hiring manager evaluating interviews of candidates for various technical roles. You are VERY critical — you are looking to hire only the most exceptional people and so your bar is very high. You only give the highest scores to candidates who are truly exceptional.

## Rubric

This is a rubric to assess the technical competence of a candidate in the context of an interview. It is designed to base all evaluation on evidence that is observable from candidate responses.

## Question-Response Level Features

Assess the candidate’s response to a given question and score them based on the associated rubric for expertise. Your score should be directly based on evidence from the candidate’s response; use the questions listed below to guide your evidence gathering process. For each of the following subcategories, **does the candidate**:

**Expertise**
  1. Use technical terminology accurately?
  2. Showcase deep knowledge of technologies, methodologies, and frameworks through concrete examples (real or imagined)?
  3. Show good judgement in using the optimal level of technicality for their given use case?
  - 1 = Rarely uses technical terms and, when used, they are often inaccurate or misapplied. Lacks basic familiarity with relevant technologies, methodologies, or frameworks.
  - 2 = Employs some technical language but with frequent inaccuracies or in the wrong context. Knowledge of key technologies and concepts seems superficial based on examples given.
  - 3 = Technical terminology is generally used correctly, though some terms may be misused or the candidate may struggle to define terms they use. Demonstrates working knowledge of relevant methodologies/frameworks but examples don't showcase deep expertise. Level of technicality is not always well-calibrated.
  - 4 = Uses technical language accurately and can speak to technologies and frameworks in depth, though some niche terms or advanced concepts may not be fully mastered. Examples are insightful and mostly well-suited to the use case in terms of technical complexity.
  - 5 = Technical terms are used with flawless accuracy. Candidate not only meaningfully discusses key technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, but also chooses an optimal level of technicality for their given use case.

    ## Output Specifications

    Please format your output in a nested JSON as follows:

    {'expertise':
    	{'justification': ,
        'score': }
    }

    Where SCORE is an integer from 1-5, and JUSTIFICATION is a couple of sentences containing evidence which answer the guiding questions and explain the score according to the rubric.


Below you will be presented with one of the interviewee's questions/answers, I want you to evaluate with this framework in mind.

------ QUESTION/ANSWER TRANSCRIPT -----------
Interviewer: That's a very interesting application of vector databases for natural language query generation. It sounds like it has the potential to significantly enhance the user experience. Given your experience with both graph databases and vector databases, how do you see these two technologies complementing each other in the context of AI and data-driven applications?  

Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. So there could be many applications. For example, like, uh, as you see, um, like, uh, the question answering platform. Right? So in question answering platform, what we are seeing is, like, uh, we we do, uh, type in a question, uh, in in the in the search bar, and it needs to be embedded so that the, uh, so that the machine understands, like, in, uh, in in what context that we are talking about. Right? It is not just, uh, only keyword based matching that we are doing, uh, that we want to do in in AI in AI powered search. What we also want to do is context based, search through which, like, we can have much more better, uh, recommendations or much more precise answer that we want to, uh, look for from the whole domain. So one such ways is, uh, like, uh, if we have to integrate, uh, if we have to combine vector databases and knowledge graph together. So let's say we have all our, uh, database in the form of knowledge graph, and it is through some um, entities through which we are defining each of the clusters or the, um, data model that we are designing for the knowledge graph. If we let's say we want to store it into a new 4 g environment or any other environment, that can be as a base layer on top of that. Like, if, uh, now let's say we are using, uh, a vector database through which, like, uh, we are provide we are providing enough question, and that goes through multiple layers. And then it goes to the, uh, then it goes to the knowledge graph to to understand, like, which of the entities are relevant to that particular question. That can be extracted through, uh, that can be extracted, um, by leveraging the vector databases, uh, through getting the embeddings of similar words that are coming frequently. Uh, and, uh, the type of most frequent question that are asked, what are the top recommendation that are getting asked? So all those things can be integrated together through which, like, we can have this pipeline of, uh, whenever there is a question that is sent in, like, we can, uh, embed it, and we can store it into a vector database now. Then from there, like, uh, we can, uh, we we can hit the knowledge of database and get the relevant entities, uh, for a particular users. And this way, like, all the, uh, relevant, uh, all the relevant entities that are coming up, uh, we can, uh, use them to, again, uh, embed and store them, uh, for, uh, later for recommendation purposes for for, uh, generating answers to the question that they asked or or or to create, uh, much a new information from the, uh, understanding that we have. Like, for example, like, if you want to generate a new type of a summary, like, uh, let's say, uh, uh, give me a summary of all the projects that you have worked on as a a software engineer. So it, uh, so, uh, so it it can go to the knowledge graph database, and it will collect the entities of the projects that, uh, you have worked on. And it will summarize, and it will then give the results. So through which, like, uh, we we can, uh, facilitate much more functionalities in in in in the coming future.
