Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've led a team at Merck Group focusing on Regulatory Management & Trade Compliance in LatAm. Can you elaborate on how you specifically used Python and Pandas to streamline processes in this project? 
Interviewee: Sure. Uh, so currently, I work as as mentioned in the regulatory team. And what we currently have is a lot of manual reports that need to be delivered, uh, periodically into, um, specific countries authorities in LatAm. So what we have been doing with, uh, Pandas and and Python is to automate this report. So most of the data sources are currently in SAP. So what we did is we automated some bots to go and log in to the, uh, specified SAP necessary to, um, to get the data for that report. And then we extract that data. Most of the data normally comes with a few um, incorrect, you know, empty values and things like that. So we use Pandas to kind of do a, uh, ETL on it. And after that is all corrected, we normally have to build the reports, uh, according to what the authority sent as a template. So it usually requires data from multiple tables in SAP, or multiple transactions. And the automations we do normally go into these tables or transactions, puts up the parameters needed. You know, uh, some are specific to some materials. Others are specific to, uh, to, um, uh, period. So a month, maybe a week. And we extract that data, do some data analysis, usually, uh, some lookups in in each of these tables, create the specific template for the the authority, and then we use Selenium to go to the authority website and upload normally, uh, when it's a a more organized authority, we just upload the report as is. So it's, uh, a simple step of logging into the authority website. And uploading the the Excel report, which is normally the preferred, um, the preferred output. And in the worst case, we normally have to register each of the the rows in the Excel Excel as a as a specific, uh, input. So then we have a more complicated selenium bot that goes in, includes every each line of the report, and sends the report to the authority. So that's that's pretty much, uh, how we use Pandas, Selenium, and and Python in my day to day work.

Example 2 (Score 4): 
<example_2>
Interviewer: Certainly, I was asking about the concept of 'one-hot encoding' and how it is applied in machine learning. Could you walk me through the process of one-hot encoding and explain why it is necessary in certain machine learning tasks? 
Interviewee: Okay. So the one hot encoding, it refers to the strategy used in machine learning and data preprocessing where the categorical variables are encoded into binary vectors with each category represented by a unique binary value 0 to 1. So in it, how it work is that, first of all, we use categorical variables that represent categorical such as colors like red, blue, green. And in one hot encoding, each category is a categorical variable that is assigned a unique binary value. For example, lights let's say I had taken an example of colors where red, blue, and green. So we can assign red as 100, blue as 010, and grade may be represented as like 1. So it is commonly used in ML algorithms, especially with categorical variables that do not have inherent ordinal relationship. It allows algorithm to effectively process categorical data as numerical input as most machine learning require numerical input data. So the benefit of one hot encoding is that from assuming any ordinal relationship between categories that might not exist, it requires that each category is treated as a distinct and independent entity during model training.

Interviewer: It sounds like you've implemented a robust system combining automated checks with manual oversight to maintain data integrity and privacy. Shifting focus to your design skills, you mentioned creating a significantly better interface. Can you walk me through your design process using Figma, and how you ensured that the user experience was aligned with the needs of your transporters and SMBs? 
Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so the thing is, uh, right now, I mean, if you want, I can show you, uh, the, um, like, my Figma sketches, but, uh, I'm not sure, like, I would be able to access those files right at the moment, but then I'll explain you the thought process. The thought process was, uh, ensuring what Indian transport SMEs typically prefer. They prefer WhatsApp US. They prefer coming their communication happening with mobile phone over any other apps. So I made sure that our app UI is very coherent with what what WhatsApp UI is and what call logs are. So they kind of feel this app is natural extension to what they have already been using. They they use typically phone calls and, like, in the personal connections. Uh, so one key, uh, feature was, uh, like, instead of having multiple, you know, multiple sections of that which they have to learn and explore, Uh, we kind of did a a call log kind of test in which, uh, the whole UI appeared as if, like, it was a series of call log interactions with other users. So there was post, there was track, there was, you know, call call made, call received. That type of interaction on a unified interface, uh, makes it very interesting for somehow, like, for the, uh, Indian consumers, uh, the transport SMBs. They don't like uh, want to learn different subsections and subsections of, uh, like like, you have typically, what a competitor would do is, uh, like like, what what other competitive apps are doing is they are they're having like, there is a top marketplace. There is a loan marketplace. Uh, then there is my load section, my truck section. Like, 4, 5 sections, it it's placed into it. But, no, but what why users are preferring online communities? Because it feels like a live interaction. Uh, like, one thing after another, not not necessarily categorized into different things. So that's that that's how we leverage our UI insights. 
Evaluation:

Interviewer: Certainly. Can you explain the difference between using the "apply" function and a vectorized operation in Pandas for data manipulation, and in what scenarios you would choose one approach over the other? 
Interviewee: Okay. In pandas, a vectorization is very, very much important. Because the pandas data frame is main data frame, which uses to handle the empty values and, in a Panda's data frame, it is to convert, data into data frame. It means it is useful for to visualize the data in a row and column format. So if you have, consider a repos like columns, If you have many columns, then, representation of means visualizing it individually will be too complex. So that's why in the pandas, there is a beautiful thing called data frame, which combines all these vectors, like, which combines all these columns and which helps to, we go through all the columns at a time. So this will be helpful for us. So the in this way, the panels will be useful. And in my in my scenario also, I took the data and I converted data from using the pandas. That's it.
